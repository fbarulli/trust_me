Best customer service PERIOD,James Kostich,US,1,5,"I’ve been doing so much research on optics the last several months on optics for my new hunting rig and my AR.

This includes hensoldt, Zeiss, Swarovski, Tangent Theta, Nightforce, Vortex Razors, March etc. I’ve yet to look through this optic, but after talking to John on 2 occasions and watching Ron Spomers review. I truly believe I made a great choice. Japanese manufacturing and Schott glass at this price point is unbelievable. Plus being a veteran I qualify for their discount. I will add to my review once I have the optics in hand, but I’d be willing to bet my eyes at 40 years old wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between these optics and some that cost a lot more. I can’t wait.","James - Thank you for the initial review and your willingness to let others know about our company and products.

Superior Product/Unmatched Customer Service,Chuck Tarinelli,US,1,5,"After LOTS of research on binoculars, I decided to try Tract.

I was searching optics for my next weapon in 6.5 creedmoor, i came across a new optic for me by the name of Tract.

Coach Kate is 10/10!,Victoria Mueller,GB,1,5,"My coach, Kate, is incredible! She has helped me completely change my lifestyle by demystifying the science behind nutrition. I've learned that my previous definition of ""healthy eating"" was completely unbalanced and counterproductive to achieving my goals. After working with Kate, I am SO motivated to continue this fitness and health journey and turn it into a lifestyle. I feel like I am now armed with the knowledge to actually succeed this time around, after countless times trying and failing to lose weight and eat healthier. Aside from that, Kate is a truly wonderful person and I can tell she genuinely cares about her clients and wants to see them achieve their goals. Her upbeat messages encourage me on tough days when I don't feel like showing up and putting in the work. I hope to one day inspire someone else to transform their life like Kate has done with me!",False,"December 10, 2024"
Great service!,Michael,US,1,5,"Great experience with Caliber.  I had contacted/tried several online coaching providers and no one really would do what I needed.  As someone experienced in athletic training and capable of making my own programming, I had the tendency to try to ramp up my training too fast which caused several stops and starts.After I reached out, Caliber scheduled a consult and we discussed what my goals were and how the program worked.  Based on that discussion I was confident that I could get what I wanted out of the coaching service and agreed to a 90 day program.Caliber paired me up with a great coach in Regi Drake and after a detailed consult, Regi understood exactly what I needed and cooked up a tailored program  that was doable with my gym setup.Regi was very much on the ball on keeping me honest and we had an open line of communication at any time through the Caliber app/platform.  He recommended weights, intensities, and generally just checked in on me to make sure I was getting it done. Regi is also a genuine and personable guy who seems invested in his clients successes.After 90 days I am back in a regular workout routine and making it a habit again to exercise daily.Overall a great personalized service and I would recommend both Caliber and Regi without hesitation.",False,"December 16, 2024"

The kit installed and tuned very easily, shifts crisp and precise and I was provided with everything I needed.  Only gripe (minor) is the limit screws were at strange extremes of adjustment as received and the H screw cannot be adjusted into range until a chain is put on.  If it is adjusted into range, the cage of the derailleur contacts the cable pull connection on the derailleur body and prevents movement further. A lockout to hold the cage fully extended would solve this and be a nice feature.  The L screw also has a minor tool access issue, fouling the hex key wrench into the cable stop arm.

"Great wheels, even better customer service",Runner from Newton,US,6,5,"I purchased RYOT44 wheels with decals and am delighted with the product and the customer service that FFWD provided from their US offices. My order was processed quickly and the in-stock wheels were shipped out the next day.When the wheels arrived (the decals were shipped separately), I saw that UPS had torn part of the packing box and that rip extended to the bubble wrap inside.  Fortunately, the wheels were sitting inside a very sturdy carrying case and there was no visible evidence of damage to the rim, spokes or hub.  Nevertheless, when I mounted the rear wheel, I saw there was slight side-to-side wobble (the rear wheel was closest to the side of the box that was damaged).I contacted FFWD's Customer Service and they could not have been more responsive.  They told me that I could take the wheel to my local shop and have it trued and they would refund me the cost for that.  I did so and within minutes of my emailing them the receipt from the shop, they issued a credit to my credit card account so all is good.The wheels feel fast on the road and the DT Swiss 240 freehub is quieter than the stock freehub.  Overall, I'm very pleased with RYOT wheels and the way FFWD does business.  The fact that FFWD provides full specs and detailed product datasheets on their website is also a plus in terms of confidence about their products.",We truly appreciate your business and thorough review!

After all the seasons, the bag is still in top shape with only having one stick elastic band break after all this time.

Not exactly what I expected of a practical instructor training day,K. de Wit,NL,2,2,"The B1 training day was for sure very informative. Though I missed a lot of things in this training: 1) More dancing time as the day was quite passive for a instructor training (20 minutes of zumba dancing on the whole day, so no balance in theoretical-practical part. We were hinting to the ZES trainer we wanted to dance more during the day, but this has been ignored); 2) making your own playlist and testing out the different outcomes (how to create the ideal playlist? --> more tips were welcome!); 3) dancing on some songs of the newest release (so you know what you're missing out when you don't have ZIN); 4) practising with cueing (this part was very theoretical, not practical at all while I was hoping for that to be. If I want theory, I can get that on the B1 review videos and the manual); 5) the training day was way shorter than communicated (the sign in page said the day would be from 8AM till 4PM. At the end the day started at 9AM and was finished i a rush at 3PM, so 2 hours less).Something I liked was breaking up the core steps of each style, so we can perform them better and give better instructions to our class. During that moment we were also given opportunities to ask whatever we wanted to know, what created some depth in the program.I also like the moments where you could speak to other future zumba instructors who were too attending this training day.I definitely could use the new information in my future classes, but the manual and review videos of the training gave also a lot of the same information. I was missing some in depth quality which I expected this training would capture.

Outstanding Quality & Customer Service!,John Cashwell,US,1,5,"I am blown away by the speed at which Creedmoor Sports managed to get my order shipped out to me.

For instance: If you were the customer> How quickly would you expect items to be shipped? At the price point for a particular product, what should the quality of materials, quality assurance and craftsmanship of the product be? Is it a fair price for what you are offering? And so on. Creedmoor Sports absolutely knocked at out of the park by exceeding every expectation of mine. I bought the Lyman All-American8 Turret and it is a work of art & perfection! In fact the day that I received it was the day that I suddenly recalled that when I watched the Ultimate Reloader video on the product many months ago that there was a Press Upgrade Kit that could be purchased along with it and I now I had to go back and order that and wait a week to 10 days for it to show up. In the notes section of the order form I mentioned that ""I cannot believe that I forgot to order this Upgrade kit when I ordered the tool head"".

We truly value your business and appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.We understand how important it is to receive your order quickly, especially during the holiday season. Your order was shipped via UPS 2nd Day Air service to ensure a fast delivery; however, we want to clarify a few details regarding shipping timelines during this time of year.Your order was placed on Sunday, December 22nd, and while we worked to process and prepare it for shipment immediately on Monday, UPS does not operate pickups on Sundays and does not deliver on Christmas Day.

The trade off in their offering is simply timing, because they seem to map out jobs monthly and create routes based on orders, so if you're a little patient you can save a lot.",False,"March 15, 2024"

For a $1000 product!!I am out $1000. What a scam.  BUYER BEWARE!!!","There are two sides to every story. Catherine flew to California from North Carolina for in-person fittings that Ms. Barker participated in. After trying on several sizes, an order was placed.Ms. Barker was sent a new vest in perfect condition. The vest model that Ms. Barker purchased has elastic laces whose termination points are housed in a grommet. Contrary to Ms. Barker's statement, the lace did not snap. She pulled on the grommet with force and one of the ends of the laces popped out. We offered to help her re-insert the lace on a video call and also offered to send a video showing how to do this - a process that takes about 10 seconds, yet she refused. Per the pictures Ms. Barker sent, the lace was perfectly intact and had no breakage other than the end being out of the grommet.Ms. Barker then sent the vest back to us, but the lace had intentionally been completely removed from the vest, per Ms. Barker's admission.

Had I known this I might have opted for a different product that would reach me sooner.  In the end, I did receive the product with which I am happy.","Hi Karen, thanks so much your order. Your vest was in stock in the United States. The shipping cost you are referencing is because your order was an international shipment. We ship vests for free within the United States but unfortunately do need to charge for international shipping. Because shipping gas canisters across borders takes additional paperwork and handling time, as well as extra processing at the border, these shipments do indeed take a few extra days for delivery.

In addition she sent the wrong cartridge with the vest which might have caused a serious injury to the end user.  Not to mention that the owner is uncooperative and rude in her dealings with customers. Rider beware!  Using this business can cost you your life!,"Hi Margaret,We were waiting for your review and definitely weren’t disappointed in receiving it, especially after you took to Facebook claiming that the owner of the company is incompetent. Thankfully, we have hundreds of reviews indicating that we do in fact know what we’re doing and based on the phone calls and emails we get each day, we’re blessed and grateful to have helped thousands of people stay safer in the saddle. To our knowledge, we haven’t caused anyone’s death, and certainly don’t plan to any time soon.To recap, you were fitted virtually, then refitted in person, then resent vests yet another time. We even went so far to send you a vest at no cost so that you could compare the different options AGAIN. You then claimed that we sent you a used vest and threw a proper temper tantrum, threatening to take us through the judicial system (because you are a lawyer after all) if we didn’t send you yet ANOTHER vest. You also declined to participate in any troubleshooting calls for us to validate any of your claims.We don’t respond well to threats, which we guess you’re not accustomed to, so we asked you to please return the vest that was sent as a courtesy - you know, the one that you didn’t already ride in based on the pictures you sent us and you claimed you didn’t want because it was used anyways.You then proceeded to keep both vests, including the one you didn’t pay for. I believe that in judicial speak we call that possession of unpaid goods. We emailed multiple times asking for the return and finally, after multiple points of contact, we got the unpaid vest back - 6 weeks later. Our return policy is very strict - 14 days to ensure that we don’t have a safety product out of our control and we do thorough inspection when we receive the vests back to ensure they are suitable for sale. At 6 weeks, we can no longer sell this vest, as our clients’ safety is our utmost priority.For our wonderful clients out there, these are the facts of this case - they can be slippery suckers, but they always find an appropriate place to land. :)","February 15, 2024"

The pop-off pedals solve that problem.","Hi Joseph,Thanks for this great feedback.

Hammer Down Enterprises knuckles,James Gosselin,US,1,5,"I was looking at the ZRP knuckles for an X3/XRS and luckily, I found Hammer Down enterprises knuckles and oversized bearing/Hubs. They are beautifully machined and engineered for long lasting usage. I believe they have a better design with regards to wear on components and bolt right up to your stock parts. Depending on what aftermarket upper control arms you have, it might take a little modification to get dialed in, but you can't make a part that works with every aftermarket set-up. I purchased the Lonestar MTS kit and with a little modifying on the upper control arms the knuckles worked great. Same mods would have to be done with the ZRP's, that's just what you have to do if you want I true double sheer contact point on the top control arm. Hammer also did a great job taking care of me from the beginning to the end and even shipped me out some of their new 36 MM caps for the upgraded larger size bearing/axle nuts and that was months after I purchased their product.

Great experience!,Mara Holt,US,5,5,"After almost 4 weeks in the program, I feel more capable and energetic. I have counted calories for years, but I haven’t paid formal attention to protein and fiber. Having protein and fiber goals has kept me from feeling the incessant hunger that I have felt with other diets.I am much more motivated because of the gentle accountability that Belle has provided. Belle is a perfect coach. She is responsive, always there when I need her, always positive and encouraging. The teamwork keeps me on track. I have been on a lot of diets in my life, and I know my pitfalls pretty well, and Belle listens to me and helps me incorporate my successful strategies into the program. If she makes a suggestion that I know won’t work for me, she will modify it. She knows that if I do well on a smaller goal that I will push past that goal when I am ready.I am enjoying new foods and the creativity of putting ingredients together to develop the right balance of calories, protein, and fiber. And I’m able to do more in a day without getting as tired as I used to get. I look forward to exercise and to the next recipe.",We're so glad Belle is giving you the accountability that you need and it's helping maintain your energy levels.

There’s never any shame or guilt if you miss a goal but definitely feeling strong accountability for what I’ve set out to do. So far I’m incredibly happy with this program.",Thank you for this amazing feedback! We're delighted to hear you've found our program supportive and empowering.

I love this program,An,US,2,5,I love this program. I have a binge eating disorder. Before I started Fitmate I was looking for a plan that would help keep me on track with healthy eating. I needed to tell someone what I was eating daily to keep me accountable. Fitmate is doing that. My coach Sam is leading me gently to a healthier life. The program is doable. I have daily goals that Sam has established for me. If I have any doubts about achieving a goal I communicate that to him and we adjust it. I have been looking for something like this program for years. Thank you Fitmate.,We're so glad our service is working for you and helping you manage your weight in a sustainable and healthy way. Well done on progress to date!,"August 09, 2024"
It’s built on a higher lean protein +…,CLB,US,1,5,"It’s built on a higher lean protein + high fiber + lower fat model. Set goals each week with a coach who you can set up quick video checkins with. Goals can seem a little formulaic (eat lean protein, get more fiber, drink enough water) but if you ask for other goals the coach can design any goal you want (do relaxation exercises, pre-plan snacks etc). I think the key is to know what you need and ask for it if their baseline goals and interactions are not what you are looking for.","Thanks for the review, glad you are finding the goals useful! We'll be improving the visibility of custom goals in the coming months in the app as well.","August 29, 2023"

True Coaching at your fingertips!,Lana,US,1,5,"What I like most is their honesty. These coaches do a great job of critiquing meal options, making recommendations, and offering guidance on how to do it better next time, if necessary.

Great experience...highly recommend!,Candace D,US,3,5,"I like that this is done through messaging rather than phone calls, but at the same time it feels very personal as my coach is very responsive when I message her, and she checks up with me on days I don't message her.

After months of physical therapy (post surgery) and rebuilding my leg muscles, I was ready to return to full-body strength training.I knew my heavy weightlifting days were behind me, so I consulted my physical therapist and physician after reading about Katalyst. My physician approved, so my wife and I both bought suits (we share a power pack). We were optimistic but skeptical. After trying it, we were blown away. Not only have we used the suits for 100% of our resistance training (2 to 3 times per week), my suit has helped me with my recovery. I’m stronger than I’ve ever been. Additionally, my wife’s achy joints (from playing college soccer) are better after giving up traditional weights for Katalyst.Thanks Katalyst! We plan to be lifers.",False,"December 07, 2024"
Simple and effective way to see results,Andrew,US,1,5,"Simple and effective way to build muscle!

Almost two years later and I have never been stronger, leaner, and my lower back pain is totally gone. I'm more fit than I was in my twentites, and I've always been physical and in shape.

2.5 years,Kevin S.,US,1,5,"Katalyst has been a game-changer for my physical health. I've been doing Katalyst workouts three times per week for over two years' now.

As a former collegiate baseball player, I had fallen out of shape after hanging up the spikes. Generally, my personality type needs a coach to push me to my limits. Katalyst has effectively taken that role. In any given Katalyst workout, i'm dripping with sweat and totally gassed at the end of each workout. Just prep the suit, pick a workout and press go!  It absolutely pushes me to the max!Time is also important. As both a father of young kids and a business owner - i need to fit-in workouts in an extremely busy schedule.
