Decent Sportswear Clothing,PurpleBand,4,I’ve bought items from Nike over the years and quality seems to be generally good - apart from a random T-shirt years ago and slightly wearing Air Max 95 approximately 10 wears from new. Ordering is easy and I appreciate the free delivery. My local Nike outlet has a decent range of stock but I love Nike overall has a selection for everyone. Discounts from external providers are okay but their own loyalty programme needs improvement and never had to deal really with customer service other than returns which were handled great.,2025-02-19T00:40:05.000Z,Nike
Nike is the most inflexible company I…,Mrs Hall,1,Nike is the most inflexible company I have had to deal with. We travelled one hour to their Birmingham outlet after checking the Nike website for their closing times. Website had incorrect information and the shop was closing in two minutes and they refused to let us in. Today I had to deal with customer service regarding exchanging some trainers that were a gift for a child. Absolutely no flexibility for a shop that makes so much profit!! We are switching to other sports brands from now on.,2025-02-17T21:22:22.000Z,Nike
Trash ,Shanz,1,Unbelievable! Accessories from £200 trainers are missing. Customer service is useless. Months later to be told I have to return the trainers for a refund and can't have the parts missing sent. Charge loads but have had better service from cheaper sites. Keep your money or spend it else where!! AVOID ,2025-02-16T16:12:56.000Z,Nike
Terrible quality and even worse…,Ivan Petruzzelli,1,"Terrible quality and even worse customer service. Joggers developed multiple circular holes from fabric deterioration - clear manufacturing defect. Reported to Nike in November 2024 with photos and proof of purchase. They ignored for 5 weeks, then tried deflecting blame to retailer. When I explained the retailer confirmed this was a manufacturing issue, Nike simply stopped responding in January 2025.Absolutely disappointed in both product quality and how Nike handles defects. They don't stand behind their products and ignore legitimate quality complaints. Save your money and buy from a company that actually cares about their customers.",2025-02-18T18:13:17.000Z,Nike

Nike: customer service absolute useless,Neil Harvey,1,"My Christmas Nike gift card, that was purchased in Tesco, was scammed by someone unbeknown to me, who had taken note of the card/pin numbers before I had purchased it. So when I went to purchase using the card there was a nil balance on it. Phoned Nike customer care - they were not interested, called me a liar, were rude/abusive and put the phone down on me. No complaints section and no manager to speak to - Nike the company that takes your money but provide no service/care.",2025-02-10T23:59:22.000Z,Nike
Horrible treatment and customer service ,Micheal mckay,1,"I ordered from here a gift for my sons birthday, it was supposed to arrive 2 days in advance.

Dont buy Nike online from Nike.com! They will send you the bad shoes.,Petter Andreasson,1,"Dont buy Nike online from Nike.com!I bought 2 pairs of the same style. One to have in the gym and one to wear on the streets. Both pairs were bad. One left shoe was dirty, a lot. The suede looks horrible. The other pair was completely unmatched, one was smooth and proper the other one ""cracked"" looked like the right shoe had been compressed for a long time. Probably will never buy Nike again. And definitely never online from nike.  ",2025-02-15T23:09:16.000Z,Nike
Scammed For My Money And No Reimbursement.,Sam,1,"I have ordered 2 shoes for me and my girlfriend and black Nike hoodie for my self, ordered on 25th Jan, and was supposedly meant to be delivered to me on the 27th of Jan, however, as per shown in the DPD delivery photograph too, my parcel was delivered to another door to another floor and a completely different person of different ethnicity. Had taken them 1 month and 10 days to get back to me with the first decision of the investigation, telling me it was delivered to the correct address when I do not have the goods with me and clearly shown on the delivery photograph that the parcel was delivered to a completely different person, and I have checked with all neighbours in my apartment and no one seems to have it. following a re-investigation which got back to me a week later letting me know they can’t do anything about the situation. What makes matters worse is I have a paper stuck to my door addressing that my parcels should kindly be left on front of my door. I am enraged with this situation as my order totals to a sum of £429.97 and I am here left with a large sum of money missing from my account and also none of the goods I have paid for with my hard earned money, let alone my valentines gifts for my girlfriend being ruined. I am a customer of Nike since 2021 and I will not be shopping from them again as I feel very disrespected and disregarded and scammed. I do not recommend spending large amounts of money on Nike online, you will be disappointed and disregarded.",2025-02-18T18:22:59.000Z,Nike
Don't order online from them you will be disappointed ,Dmitri,1,", their customer service is unhelpful and dismissive. When I tried to return a defective pair of shoes, they refused to take responsibility, blaming ""wear and tear"" even though the shoes were barely used.

Absolutely shocking customer service,michael barber,1,"Absolutely shocking customer service. Purchased a pair of trainers prior to Christmas and what I received through the post a worn pair of trainers, with dirt around the soles and also had glue all the way around the joint between the rubber sole and leather. I put a complaint in and after constantly getting fobbed off by their ""Athletes"" in Netherlands and Germany, eventually after 3 weeks got through to a manager.Was offered an apology and a gift voucher and code I could use on my next purchase. On my next purchase the gift card and voucher wouldn't work. I was told to purchase the new trainers, then call up and they would refund me this amount. Needless to say they haven't done this and it has now been over a week! - Can never speak to anyone senior. Been promised a call back probably 6 times now, but every time they don't bother! - shocking poor customer service for any company let alone a multi-billion pound company - Interesting to see all the comments on here. Its disgusting how they treat their customers",2025-02-11T12:32:19.000Z,Nike

Don’t purchase from Nike app,Kyle Groenewald,1,"Don’t purchase from Nike app. It’s a waste of time. I place an order, order gets canceled without reason. I call an agent. The he agent says I must supply them with an ID number. However, I cannot add my ID number in the app or online. Then why even try sell anything? Nike app is pathetic. If you can’t add ID don’t buy. Support is absolutely useless. Chat bot is extremely useless. If I could give no stars I would. I would like to add. They tell me I need to add my ID number. If you try to enter it nothing happens.

They have said there was an issue sending the refund and it’s been raised to the senior team and I should hear back in 3-5 days. They received the shoes a week ago and did nothing till I started chasing it up after checking tracking, I had the same issue before Christmas returning a pair with defects for a replacement and that took weeks to get sorted. Would never buy directly off Nike again two issues in a row which take weeks to resolve is unacceptable from one of the biggest brands in the world. ",2025-02-03T15:29:10.000Z,Nike

And that's just 5min walk to bus and 5min from bus to work.I wanted and size was too big. I asked to be sent half size smaller and explained issue.The next day I tried other shoes (exactly same(even colour) as I had before, but I though ill die walking in them, my foot was breaking on half so I thought there might be some issue with it.Sent it back as well. 15 days later still no money back or no replacement.  Today I finally was told they will process my refund but will take another atleast 9 days. This was on chat.

Poor Quality. Even Worse Delivery,Michael Miller,1,Had to order the same shoe three times from Nike.com. First pair was used. Second pair had excessive glue on one shoe. Last pair I didnt even open because the delivery person for Lasership literally threw the package onto my porch and damaged my porch. I have it on camera.

When I asked to speak to a supervisor or a complaints desk, I was told it was not possible. There appears to be no procedure to complain about the customer service, or to follow up on an issue that chatbot/help desk are not empowered to resolve. Still have not been reimbursed. Dreadful.

Poor performance ,John,1,"I purchased a pair of air Jordan 1 s on June 7th 2024. The shoes were more expensive than I had hoped to spend however I justified the cost with the thought that they were high quality and would last a long time. In less than six months I noticed that a hole had worn completely through the soles of both shoes. I used the shoes to play pickleball approximately twice a week for one to two hours each time. I feel that the shoes did not last as long as they should. I contacted Nike customer service and paid the shipping cost to send the shoes for inspection. To my surprise the response from Nike was that the shoes were not defective, normal wear and tear and there was nothing that they could offer. Very disappointed and I will not be purchasing any more of Nike’s products.",2025-01-27T18:11:00.000Z,Nike

Nike refusing to refund me!,Aaron F,1,Nike refusing to refund me!I bought some trainers from Nike online however they did not fit me so I opted to return the items for a refund. I opened a return through the website. Nike offered several return options and I chose InPost locker return. This involved finding an InPost locker and using the code given from Nike to drop off the parcel in the locker. It was then picked up and returned to Nike by InPost. I did this on the 13th January and it was delivered to Nike on 16th as I can see this on the tracking link provided. Nike however are claiming the parcel did not arrive with them and are refusing to issue me a refund leaving me over £500 out of pocket. They are refusing to investigate my issue and are just telling me it's my problem. InPost have confirmed to me that the delivery was made to the correct place. Terrible service from Nike in this instance. I have followed all the instructions as they told me so I am not sure what to do now. I feel completely abandoned by Nike.,2025-01-27T19:41:21.000Z,Nike

Nike's customer service is absolutely…,Grant Robertson,1,Nike's customer service is absolutely shocking. For a company this size it should be embarrassed with their customer service. My experience has certainly put me off shopping with Nike again. The Nike advisor i was unfortunate enough to get kept talking over me and out the phone down when I was talking then picked the phone back up. I kidded on I had asked a question to which they obviously couldn't answer as they weren't listening and tried to kid on the line when dead.I returned my faulty pair of Nike trainers under their two year warranty. They have said they didn't not receive them even though I have produced the proof of returns label via royal mail. It also shows the date and time it was delivered to Nike. They said I have to take it up with Royal Mail but the fault lies with Nike even if the parcel did go missing (which it hasn't) as they were the ones that provided the return label.I have had to contact my bank and do a charge back to get my money back. Once I explained everything to my bank they were more than happy to do a charge back as I had my returns recipet etc.If you have an issue like this I would go through your bank for a refund as Nike is absolutely useless. ,2025-01-29T14:26:32.000Z,Nike
If I could give a zero I would,Racquell Schwartz,1,If I could give a zero I would. I was sent shoes that were dirty and blood stained. I reached out within 6 mins of opening my package and was on with customer service for over 40 mins requested to speak with a supervisor and after being placed on hold the rep came back to tell me no supervisor was available. And that the best he could do is have me return the shoes and wait 10 days for my refund. At this point I have no shoes for our photo shoot and also out of the money that was used to pay for them. He told me wait 24-48 hours for a call and it has since been 30 hours and no supervisor has reached out regarding this major inconvenience. I fail to understand how a billion dollar company can totally disregard customer service and customer satisfaction. ,2025-01-16T02:27:59.000Z,Nike

Dealing with call handlers who have no authority than to give repeated textbook responses and pass you back and forth with no resolutions. I had a fault pair of shoes that Nike received over one month ago and refused to refund because they don’t have a level of authority to do so, despite they would be furious if they were me. Today I finally got a live chat member who took me through security questions so indicated they must be elsewhere and refunded me without hesitation. Changed my review as resolved the issue but Nike, look at your standard of service and sort this out, it’s awful for such a huge company!

Nike issued the refund of 37.48euro to my PayPal account on 2nd Jan. 2025, but it was cancelled and never came through to my account. I have since spoken with customer service team of nike.com on 3occasions on 14th, 28th, 30th January to solve this. Each time they make me send some more details of the transactions or passing the book to some other departments that I have no ways of access to and telling me to wait, but yet nothing is solved.  I feel I have been fobbed off altogether. This is very frustrating and stressing me out.  On the 3rd phonecall, I got a bit excited on the phone telling them how frustrated I feel, then I was told I have been unprofessional and they hung up on me.

Terrible company,Nancy Jones,1,"Terrible company. I bought a sweatshirt from Nike Strength for my son in law for Christmas. He needed a larger size. He went to a Nike store to return and they would not take it. It was a hassle getting the return label which I had to pay for. Then it took forever to get the credit for the sweatshirt. Then I wanted to simply give him a gift card as I was worn out w co. only to find out they only do $50, $100,etc. increments - no custom dollar amount. I decided to reorder as I didnt want my son in law to incur costs. I paid again for ship and tax. This company does not do exchanges, this co. does not have a phone #, this company does not combine ship, this company is atrocious. I will never do business with Nike ever again. It was a costly sweatshirt and they are penny wise and dollar foolish. Must be in trouble financially due to their disgusting practices in China having the Wighurs make all their apparel.

Unfortunately I haven’t bring the receipt when I was I Midland’s outlet, their staff ask me go any Nike outlet store also can do refund.I called the CS yesterday to reconfirm it can be return or refund. I went Swindon Designer Outlet Nike shop today, explain to them all the problems of the shoes. BUT Swindon Designer Outlet Nike Shop can’t do the refund, the staff are rude, and use different excuses to reject for refund.This is the worst and rudest shop I met in the UK.

No Christmas present for my nephew thanks to Nike Canada,Houston,1,"Purchased shoes on Dec 5. Paid $40 for expedited shipping which ensured they would arrive before Christmas. It is now Christmas Day and guess what? No shoes.  Contacted Customer Service on Dec 23 and Dec 24. They were able to tell me that they have no information other than the order is still ""preparing for shipment"" and that someone would get back to me within 24-48 hours. Clearly that brings us to after Christmas. I had to ask twice if they were going to refund me the expedited shipping charge. I am very put off by this lack of customer service and then I have to ask if they are going to refund me on the shipping and still no answer as to when the order is coming.... if at all.",2024-12-25T22:19:04.000Z,Nike

They want you to correct errors they make as a company ,Bertie Brayley,1,Where to start ! Ordered a tracksuit that cost over £200 and have been sent the wrong jumper but the correct trousers so it doesn't match! The jumper that has been delivered is worth alot less and doesn't match.I've spoke to a nike Athlete online through my Nike app and have been advised to go to a store which is 40 mins away as they cannot send me the correct order after the error they made.Offered me 10 % voucher code please don't insult me I've spent thousands with Nike.To top it off the nike Athlete left the conversation without resolving the issue. Just cut me off!Please remember without customers the company would be nothing.It's not acceptable that the company has made an error   and the company want a paying customer to go out of the way to correct the company's mistake it's bad service.,2024-12-16T00:41:11.000Z,Nike

Terrible delivery service,Vadim Baskakov,1,"Terrible customer serviceAn item bought through Nike.com. Firstly, at the checkout the web site rejected delivery to my home address. Nike is a first company I've ever seen who struggles to deliver to an address in a South London. I wonder where else Nike is capable to deliver if not in London? Finally, I did a checkout, however, no transaction vent though my bank account, no order confirmation. Two days later I have found that the item (surprise-surprise!) is still in my shopping basket. I have done another check out for the item to get delivered to the local Post Office. Have received a tracking number, but no confirmation which currier it is. Finally, have received a confirmation that my item is ready for pickup. Vent to the local Post Office (As advised) and found that the item is not there. Had no any chance to get to talk to any human in Nike. Looks like the Christmas Eve has started in Nike very early today. Not very impressed at all.",2024-12-24T19:10:56.000Z,Nike
Disappointing!,Conney Khang,1,"Waited 35 mins to talk to someone about my order. EST. Delivery was for today, the Nike operator stated the package would be delivered today. Well, no package. I wasted 35 mins waiting to speak with a CS rep only to have the rudest man on the phone. Spoke to me like I was stupid. Do NOT buy online. You are wasting your time calling in to track a package. I was told my order would be cancelled tomorrow if they cannot locate my shoes because it’s likely sold out, BUT their site still shows these are in stock. If anything, get your Nike gear from anywhere but Nike.com. Save yourself the hassle. Worse experience with Nike and will not be purchasing from their direct site anymore.

False adverting off a money off voucher,Carol,1,I ordered 2 sizes in the Jordan trainers as the sizing is so different to the Nike Air Force Ones and the original size I had ordered was too small and I had to return them. I had a £20 off voucher if I spent over £60 which I used in this order which totalled £149.98. I need to send one pair back and Nike have decided to split the £20 off between the 2 pairs so are only refunding me £74.99 rather than £84.99 so that the pair I am keeping would benefit from the £20 off. If I had placed an order for 1 pair this is what I would have paid.

When I called support service a second time, they said it's impossible to cancel orders after 30 minutes after ordering, in direct opposition to what I had been told previously by customer service.

I never leave reviews but £124 stolen by Nike ...,SignedupforNike,1,"I never leave reviews but Nike has the worst CS i have ever experienced. I had a voucher worth £124, and tried to place an order, the order failed to place successfully but Nike kept the voucher value as used leaving me with 1p on the voucher. They admitted that the item I was trying to buy was throwing a site error, and accepted that the voucher had now been marked as redeemed on their website, and they can clearly see no order was assigned or successfully placed at the point of 'voucher use'. So the conclusion of course is that due to technical error they have 'mistakenly' kept the voucher value. Logical solution would be to reimburse me in some way. But no, their specialist team says the voucher use was against policy and cannot be reimbursed. Ridiculous, the voucher supplier had already contacted their Nike contact point who already said it's on the specialist team to resolve and reimburse it. They did not resolve it. They decided to keep the money. All their 'NikeAthlete' CS team system does also is promote anonymity and reduce accountable to resolving cases properly. Never agian.",2024-12-23T12:39:35.000Z,Nike

Health & Safety ,carla,1,"I used to be a loyal Nike trainer wearer, but I've noticed a significant decline in their quality and design since around 2020. The trainers now have a noticeably narrower fit, which makes them uncomfortable and unsuitable for many people. Additionally, the quality of the materials has deteriorated.One glaring issue is the colorful plastic used on the outer soles. While it might look appealing, it’s clearly a cost-cutting measure. This material does not provide good grip on the ground and becomes dangerously slippery on wet surfaces. I don’t believe it meets essential health and safety standards.I believe these changes—such as the narrower fit and the use of subpar materials—pose potential risks, especially for younger generations. This could lead to long-term harm to their feet. For my part, I’ve stopped wearing Nike trainers to prioritize my foot health. However, I feel compelled to share my experience to raise awareness about these concerning issues.",2024-12-09T12:46:39.000Z,Nike

I had asked for a return label on the 7th for a specific order, and instead, they sent one for a different order.

NIKE will not honor their warranty!,Stan Melnick,1,"I purchased a pair of Nike Flex Trainers to play handball. They fit great and were quite suitable to the rigors of the game. After about one month, the shoes started to make a disastrous squeaking noise whenever i would wear them. It was annoying to me and distracting to anyone else on the court with me. I tried replacing the inserts, using talcum powder inside the shoe, but could not stop the squeak. Totally disgusted, I purchased another pair of the same model of shoes, (incorrectly) assuming that this problem was merely with this pair. Having never had this happen with any shoes, what could be wrong? Within about 6 weeks of 3x week wear, they too began to squeak. It sounded exactly like the other pair (sitting in my closet). So I contacted Nike and explained what was going on. They said to mail the shoes in and they would evaluate the defect to determine if it was a material or manufacturing defect. Two weeks go by and I receive a form letter indicating that their evaluation of the shoe has determined that it is not a material or manufacturing defect. I contacted their customer service ""athletes"" by phone, which appeared to be in other countries than ours, who said they could do nothing for me and that I should ""APPEAL"" their decision by replying to the denial letter they sent. I sent my reply, indicating that it wasn't just one pair BUT TWO OF THE SAME MODEL OF SHOE doing the same thing. I received the next denial letter, indicating that their senior quality control staff had reviewed and their findings also denied the materials and workmanship were faulty. So, now, I'm sitting with two pairs of comfortable SQUEAKY shoes that set me back close to $200 that I cannot wear. I went on-line and looked up that model of Nike shoe. It seems that over 1/3 of the people who purchased them have had the same problem with the squeaking. Those that didn't appear to be people who wore them for walking and nothing active. I am done with Nike products. They are supposed to be a company with a solid reputation. This is a poor reflection on their company. It wasn't a one-time issue. It appears to be a recurring problem they refuse to address.",2025-01-18T17:52:31.000Z,Nike

Missing Return Parcel,G. Lakatos,1,"I am deeply disappointed with my experience dealing with Nike’s customer service regarding a returned package. Here’s a summary of what happened:I returned a package to Nike around late October, expecting a straightforward refund process. Instead, I was left waiting with no updates or communication from them. After raising my first inquiry in late November, I received no meaningful follow-up or resolution. A second attempt to contact customer service in early December finally prompted a response — but only to tell me to deal directly with Evri, the courier service.Evri, however, clarified that Nike, as the account holder for the return, must escalate any claims. This means I had no way to resolve the issue myself. When I relayed this information to Nike’s customer service, they dismissed it, saying the case was closed and nothing more could be done.This experience has been beyond frustrating. The lack of accountability and the refusal to address the issue despite clear evidence from Evri reflects poorly on Nike as a brand. Their customer service has shown no urgency, transparency, or willingness to help. I’ve been left without a refund and no resolution in sight.I cannot recommend Nike based on this experience. They need to seriously rethink how they handle customer complaints and returns.",2025-01-02T14:55:26.000Z,Nike
 Very poor experience ,Sandra ,1,"I ordered 3 items. Got an email to say one item was out of stock and I would get a refund. Still waiting for that. Other 2 items due to be delivered 8 days ago. Phoned Nike, 20 mins in the queue, I asked where my order was and was told it is possibly stuck on a container and it has to be cancelled and I would be refunded. I said I was still waiting on the refund for the item which was out of stock. I was told that I should ring my bank!! I am really hoping I get the full refund but am not confident. I have not got an email confirming the cancellation and refund, but have got an email with a 25% voucher as I bought my items on Black Friday.  I told the sales advisor I would not be ordering online with them again and could I use the voucher in a Nike store, the answer was no.  This is the worst online shopping experience I have had. So surprised for a company this size. ",2024-12-08T00:33:50.000Z,Nike
NEVER AGAIN,Justin,1,"I’ve ordered 11 pairs of shoes and countless clothing items just this year alone from Nike.com. I’ve spent almost $4k this year on their site. Every order I’ve ever placed with them has been delivered through UPS and I’ve had no issues up until now. For some reason they used OnTrac to ship my items this time and it’s been a total nightmare! Upon checking my tracking number it showed delivered. I was home so I went out front and to my surprise, no package! I checked Ontracks tracking info again and realized that the driver posted a picture. Problem is, it was a picture of my package in front of someone else’s house. I immediately got in touch with Nike and they told me I would have to file a claim with OnTrac. I call Ontrack, spoke to 2 different reps and they both told me only the seller (Nike) can make a claim. So, I call Nike again, wait over an hour to speak to someone, and they basically tell me sorry, nothing we can do. So now after spending $4k with this company this year, never once having an issue, they basically tell me I’m screwed! I’m out $180 for shoes I never received. Well Nike, I can assure you that you will NEVER get another dollar out of me for as long as I live. Congratulations you lost a life long customer today. ",2024-12-20T06:25:05.000Z,Nike

Terrible customer experience,MT,1,"Recently ordered some trainers in the black Friday sale with a 25% off discount code. Trainers were due for delivery a week later and after checking order tracking page the courier listed it as ""Exception"" and that it is being sent back to Nike?? confused to say the least, I contacted Nike via the web chat. They advised that unfortunately nobody was able to collect from their courier depot, so it’s been sent back to Nike... THIS IS A HUGE NATIONAL COMPANY! the web chat advisor immediately processed a refund as I was told it wasn’t possible to send the trainers out again. I was then offered a 15% discount code to re-order but that they wouldn’t honour the black Friday discount code as it had expired. So, I was down money while I waited for my refund, I had no product and then expected to pay more than my original price not to mention the inconvenience it has caused. I then called Nike to talk to an operator who advised me that I was told the wrong information and that they could honour the discount code however I'd be expected to pay for the trainer’s full price to then be refunded the difference after? So not only do I not have my product on time, but I’m also waiting 8 working days for my original refund, I’m expected to pay the full price to then wait another 8 working days to be refunded the difference and having to wait over 2 weeks for my product. The operator didn’t listen and advised me it wasn’t within Nike's policy. Although bother operatives were friendly and apologetic on behalf of Nike I find it hard to believe this was the only solution. Terrible customer experience and unfortunately not the first bad experience with Nike.",2024-12-04T17:57:06.000Z,Nike

Wow. Site rigged again. ,BJ,1,"Wow. Their draws are so set up it's not even funny. I've witnessed it too many times to count. I hope yall know that when something is supposed to be first come first serve and in reality yall are setting there picking who wins and who doesn't thats not right and no one has a chance. Yalls site is so set up its not even funny. I've sat there and watched a draw not even open up for someone on a computer in a certain area ,which was in the U.S., until the computer was changed to make it look like it was a mobile device then bam it appeared immediately. So you mean to tell me if your on a computer you have no chance in a certain area, you can't do that. Yall lost any respect, if I even had any left, for yall. Yall could care less about a customer it's not even funny. I don't even know how your business has stayed in business that long doing people the way yall do them. Bc its real crappy and yall could care less it shows. About as fake as it gets. I'll never buy another thing from you which is stupid bc I was spending thousands weekly with nike. But they could care less on that also. I've never in my life just seen a business absolutely not care at all about their customers like that. When they mess up they act like it's normal and doesn't do anything to fix their mistakes and God do they make a bunch of them. They will send you messed up merchandise to where your constantly having to return and reorder causing you to temporarily pay twice for the item until they give your money back a week or two later. It's all ridiculous dealing with them. 9 out of 10 pairs of shoes I buy are messed up and having to be sent back. Its always problems bc their doing stupid things. I wouldn't recommend them. I wish I could cut their logo off all my stuff bc I don't even want to advertise such a crappy business. Ive never in my life seen a business try to hustle someone like they do. You pay for new things they want to send you some used or damaged items. It's a constant nightmare. They lost any respect I had left for them period today and they will be lucky if they don't see me in court where they need to be taught a lesson. You shouldn't do people like you do them. It's real crappy whether nike sees it or not and their fake bc their stuff is all set up. I've witnessed it, my husband witnessed it. It's ridiculous. It's made me absolutely hate anything to do with them. Bc their the most dishonest people I've ever seen. Such a big company has to be so dishonest just to make it,  sad really. It's sad that they have made this world feel like their not popular or wouldnt fit in unless they own nike and their nothing but lies and so fake. It would be different if you actually had a chance. You sit there and let bots eat up the sales just so the people that made the bots can sell the shoe for a thousand dollars which is absolutely ridiculous bc in reality you spent maybe 10 dollars making the shoe. It's sickening really that's it's obvious your going to let people get over on you like that to ruin it for everyone and you can't even develop a software to catch that. Bc obviously the one you got isn't working bc that's what you would claim happen when in reality it's bc yall sit there and choose if your on a mobile device in a certain region to get them which your not supposed to do.  It's supposed to be first come first serve and it's not anything like that. When I hit purchase you could still buy that size for ten mins or longer and you want to tell me you sold out. That was a lie also. You set there and picked who got them. That's not how it's supposed to be. I'll never have any respect ever for nike and wish I could return everything i ever bought from them bc they don't deserve anyone's money. It's all lies. Believe me I see you and I know the truth. That's why you try to charge someone 200 or more dollars then send them messed up items bc your hoping they accept it and them get screwed over. Its sickening really. You do it every time. Just like I have, my husband has, and many more people have seen just how set up your site really is. As fake as it gets to sit there and lie to people like you do and try to make them believe they have a chance when in reality they have zero chance ever copping a popular shoe. That's why I've Done the draws for two years and never won once and always done the sale immediately to where you could still purchase the shoes for ten mins or longer afterwards but want to tell me it's sold out. Only bc you sat there and choose who gets it. Wasn't just me that witnessed your fake site over 40x. The way yall do people has made me hate anything to do with Nike and I'm serious. I've been beyond a loyal customer to be slapped in my face countless times by them. I'm done for good. Watch and see. Believe me I don't have to wear your stuff to look good I promise. About as sorry it gets how you did me this morning. And I'm fixing to let anyone that ever asks me know the truth about how yall really do",2025-01-25T18:16:48.000Z,Nike

Do not use courier to return an item,Mohsin Fareed,5,"First Time Buying experience with Nike online, delivery was quick, but had to return 1st order, as size was small. Filled online returns form and chose drop off at In Post drop off location, received email  from courier confirming return delivered to Nike. Waited 2 weeks didn't hear anything from Nike, so rang customer services on Monday and after waiting 45 min finally got to speak to someone abroad, As requested forwarded the email from courier to Nike confirming return delivered to them, was than advised to wait few days while they look into it, no response from Nike, rang back again on Friday same week, another 30 min wait, got through to someone abroad, same process send us courier confirmation, re sent again, than another 30min later of going backwards/forwards, nike responded we have investigated our end and we have not received your return. I than politely requested a manager call back, as they were unable to do anything more, this call back they promised amd was suppose to be done within 24HRS. But it didn't happen until following Monday, while i was waiting for this call back i rang the courier In Post and they confirmed no one from Nike has been in touch to investigate this return, the courier than confirmed via email they had returned the parcel back to Nike. Out of desperation i tried their online chat service, after 45 min athlete joined the chat who just kept on giving robotic answers and wast really unhelpful, apparently the issue has now been passed to Senior Team to look into, but wouldn't say anything more than that. Monday came and received a call from a number in Netherlands, which was a manager from Nike who promised to look into the matter and respond within 7-8 days. Nike have now confirmed they have received my return which they previously said they did not, but the items returned items were not the shoes i had ordered.UPDATE!I have changed my rating from 1 to 5, fault wasnt Nikes, Nike has fully refunded me.

I had a really bad experience with the South African online store ,Na Craig,1,"I had a really bad experience with the South African online shop. I ordered goods to be delivered to an address in South Africa. The system requested that I give them an ID number, but it wouldn't accept other ID numbers such as passports etc. I reached out to the online help desk only to be told that they strictly required an SA ID. What happens to tourists? Or those wanting to purchase a gift for someone in that country? Someone really needs to look at this system because it's not friendly at all. Not everybody has the time to visit a store, or has that specific ID. I would assume that if one has a valid ID that should suffice, wherever it has been issued. Sometimes you just want to purchase something and have it delivered to your hotel etc. The online agent didnt even want to assist by providing me with an alternative way to submit the required ID. Order was automatically cancelled in the system for ''non - compliance''. It's really unfortunate.  ",2024-12-02T20:18:56.000Z,Nike
Would give no stars if I could,Consumer,1,"Would give no stars if I could. My teenage son was successful in the “drop” of some limited edition Travis Scott trainers and we paid the inflated price. The wrong, completely different trainers were delivered so we got straight on to Customer Services. The guy didn’t have a great command of English unfortunately so it was a difficult conversation. He assured me we would get the correct item when the others were returned, which we did straight away. Fast forward a few days and still no correct trainers. My son rang customer services who told him they had issued a refund. I went in the chat bot and had a very long but unfruitful chat with someone who also didn’t fully grasp what I was saying and just said there was nothing they could do and twice ignored my request to be put on to a manager. Also was told there was no address or email to write to and you can’t find one on line either.  So very disappointed in Nike who charge the earth for these trainers, market them at teenagers who get their hopes up when they think they’re getting a pair but fail to fulfill orders and then are unable to help you find any resolution to their c**k-ups. If anybody from Nike reads this (doubt it) I would love it if we could actually get the item we ordered - is that really too much to ask??

When you call the call centre, which appears to be in China, they just keep you on hold and disappear. Twenty minutes of waiting - for no result.. And they don't read emails or even acknowledge them. So I've given up. For a big name brand the service is rubbish. Don't bother. I will try elsewhere. I certainly won't go to one of their stores if this is the kind of service they give out online. No thanks!",2024-11-29T16:24:08.000Z,Nike

I raised a complaint with Nike…,leanne Keogh,1,"I raised a complaint on the Nike Chat that I would like to raise a complaint that a manager is unable to call or speak to me after me ringing 3 times today. First time, I was told someone would call me straight back and didn’t. Second time, someone would call within 2 hrs - and didn’t. Third time, someone said within 24hrs but has my request logged as urgent. I ordered Nike pro leggings and the ones I have received are infant ones, proof been sent and accepted. The problem of what I am highly disappointed in - my mum is extremely poorly and therefore as a family we are having Xmas early this year (Sunday) so my mum can give all her grandchildren Xmas presents early.I have requested that another pair that is correct size be sent (as this is not my fault) asap so as not to miss out on a present on Sunday as this will be the last present her Nana will ever give her. These are unprecedented times and I am so upset of how Nike have dealt with this and just fobbed it off with the words “our procedure is…”. Unfortunately time is not on our side and this CANNOT wait as my mum may not even make next week. I have offered to send medical evidence as this isn’t something I am making up - however - if Nike had sent the correct item, I wouldn’t have had to make 3 separate phone calls and now a message to get someone to listen to me! This is really unacceptable. I then proceeded to try through the Nike Chat and after discussing all the above... ended up saying, nothing we can do and ended the chat. SHOCKING!!!",2024-11-27T21:28:54.000Z,Nike

Ordered a pair of decent trainers, nike flight ones in sale and have to say from start to finish I could not thank nike enough for their flawless service and so glad I didn't listen to the reviews on here from all the Karen's 😂😂I was kept informed all the way via email from start to finish and also I downloads Royal mail app and was able to follow delivery from start point to the post office I had it sent to in case I missed collecting at home.Waiting on a jordan tracksuit from Nike sale which is on route.I have no complaints at all and will deffo be using nike online to buy again.Think people just moan too much today and my impression is they forget they talk to other human beings stuck on phone all day and they call up with issues without thought and just love to rant... That is not the way to deal with problems. Be polite, be courteous and be patient.Fantastic service and I can't thank nike enough for putting my fears to rest.... Absolutely made up with this service and the trainers 👌Update 28/11/24Received Jordan bottoms today. App never worked for me so used Google to enter nike site. Goods delivered by royal mail and sent post office cause I may not of been home. Great first time experience and quality what I expected from Nike....

Warranty was still good. They gave me a claim # and I had to pay 31$ for the shoes' delivery to Toronto. They said it happens and they would replace it. I figured it was good as the shoes are 225$. They emailed me saying that the shoe was damaged, there's no replacement and shipping it back to me. Why didn't they tell me this from the get go? Plus you have to pay the shipping, which isn't cheap! Such a waste of money and time. It's a disgusting experience and the service is terrible. I spent thousands and was a loyal customer.

I refuse to keep spending money on your overpriced mediocrity dressed in flashy marketing.As a loyal member since 2005, I had one simple issue that needed resolving—and your so-called “athletes” and customer service couldn’t even handle that.

The Returns process has run out and to initiate their ""investigation"" Nike require a copy of the receipt issued by AN POST when posting the return. Nothing happens without this.

There was no promo code, just a click here kind of button to place the order and the amount will be deducted when you go to pay.This didn't happen at all. So when I noticed the 25% offered was not being honoured I contacted Nike via their chat.I was advised that it would seem the code was nit working on this occasion but if I purchased the item they would refund the difference on dispatch.Did this happen? NO.Unfortunately the trainers I bought came up narrow and so I exchanged them at the Nike shop.I contacted Nike a week later to ask them about this refund of 25%. I was advised it couldn't be honoured as I had exchanged the item in store!As far as I am concerned this is a total con as what it has shown me is there was no intention to honor the 25% otherwise yiu would have done it already.If you love Nike trainer, please think twice about how they are manipulating customers.There are far more brands who value their customers and haven't become obnoxious and feel they are above treating their customers well.I've seen a number of reviewers on here who've experienced offers not being honoured.

Joggers all unisex and if not unisex boys and girls joggers piled in together on the same racks. I don't know about you bit I don't have time to try and figure out the difference in boys and girls clothes. There is minimal difference to the untrained eye. How many men would be happy wearing unisex clothes...not many.. why do teen boys have to wear unisex clothes??. I had cash to spend but after trying to differentiate the sexes. We gave up and bought what we needed in the Puma store. I get you are pro trans and thats fine but have some common sense and have some respect for your customers time. Not all of your customers want to wear the same clothes as the opposite sex and they're allowed not to. This was such an unnecessarily frustrating experience.

I am incredibly frustrated with my overall experience ,K S,1,"I am incredibly frustrated with my recent experience ordering from Nike. My order was supposed to arrive in one to three days, but it’s now overdue, and I’m still waiting. I’ve reached out to both Nike’s customer service and their delivery provider multiple times, only to be bounced back and forth with no real answers or help.Nike’s customer service has been little help—they keep telling me to check with the delivery company, but when I contact them, I’m met with vague, inconsistent information and no clear update on when my package will actually arrive. It feels like neither Nike nor the delivery company is taking any responsibility, and the lack of communication has been exhausting.For a brand as big as Nike, this is extremely disappointing. I expected better service, especially given the high standards they promote. I’m seriously considering canceling my order because I can’t rely on either the delivery company or Nike’s support. This has been an incredibly frustrating experience, and I won’t be ordering from them again if this is the level of service they provide.",2024-10-29T21:14:53.000Z,Nike

I've been a devoted Nikey customer for countless years. I couldn't even put a number on the level of Nikey apparel I own or the money I spend pretty much weekly, is absolutely ridiculous really.

Very Disappointed with Nike…,TheQueenHasHer Crown,1,"Very Disappointed with Nike Customisation and Customer ServiceI customised a pair of Nike Air Force 1s on September 7th, with a delivery scheduled for September 27th. Initially, everything seemed fine—I received all the tracking details and updates from UPS. However, on the 27th, I got a notification saying my delivery had failed and that my order had been sent to a local mini-market for collection. I also received a text message asking me to bring my ID and reference number.Firstly, I have a Ring doorbell and Reolink CCTV around my property, and no delivery attempt was made. Secondly, when I went to the mini-market, they informed me that they never received my order. I immediately contacted Nike’s customer service. During my first call, I was told that my order had been returned to Nike and was scheduled for recycling. When I asked why it couldn’t simply be resent to me, I was informed that this was their process. I requested a call back from a manager to discuss the situation further, and I was told I would receive a call within 24-48 hours.A week passed, and I had received no phone call and no refund. I called customer service again, received another apology, and was told once more that a manager would call me back—again, that call never came.After all this frustration, I finally received my refund, but I never heard back from a manager.

Reduced quality at a greater cost!,Chris Gell,1,"I have bought several NFL jerseys over the years, always opting for the more expensive 'Limited' jerseys with stitched name and numbers. I did the same when I purchased a Vapor F.U.S.E. jersey, expecting the same quality as before. At the time of my purchase (from Fanatics), I was unaware that the name and number were heat sealed, rather than stitched, along with other details on the jersey that are of a lesser quality (and yet, the price was more!). Nobody should be expected to spend upwards of £300 for an ‘Elite’ jersey just for this detail. I will never buy another Nike NFL jersey until I am satisfied that an affordable version of the jersey with stitched name and number and added attention to quality is produced (just like I have bought before).",2024-10-12T09:16:56.000Z,Nike

More staff training needed!!,Dave Armstrong,1,Took my partners teenage daughter to treat her to a new tracksuit and top. She couldn’t remember her size on the bottoms and we walked over to the changing rooms and I politely asked the girl at the entrance to the changing rooms if my step daughter could quickly go into a changing room so she could check the label on the inside back of her bottoms. The girl (who was standing with a young male colleague) said (in a very sarcastic manner) “the size is on the label in the back of her bottoms” I said I know but she needs to check as she can’t see behind her” she laughed a little which I found very condescending…I then said “could you look please” she made a sarcastic remark and I then I had to say quite embarrassingly “she’s not my daughter and I don’t want to be pulling her bottoms down to check a label in the middle of this store!” She continued to be insensitive and after a few awkward looks she eventually looked. All that unnecessary awkwardness and embarrassment could have been prevented if she’d just let my step daughter into the changing room .

I’ve found myself writing this review…,RAM,1,I’ve found myself writing this review due to a couple of recent interactions with the diabolical customer service at Nike UK. My first experience was with a parcel that I’d returned. At first they had told me it hadn’t arrived and to wait. On contacting customer service again a week later they were still adamant it hadn’t arrived back and to wait another week. I decided to track my parcel with my receipt only to find it had arrived. When I questioned customer service about this they then agreed it was back but the parcel was empty. They refused to refund me or to help with the so called missing items from the parcel. They also insisted the problem was mine and I had to contact Royal Mail. It was clear from my postage receipt that the weight of the parcel contained the returned items. I had to contact my credit card company and claim a refund on the returned items. The credit card company upheld my complaints against Nike. My second and latest experience with the UK customer service was just as rude and dismissive.  I have two fly knit bras that after only four weeks have become loose and misshapen. When enquiring as to what I should do the representative told me that they were very sorry and yes I could return them. How would I like to ship them and what was my address? I was talking to Nike USA by mistake and they told me I’d have to contact Nike UK. No problem or so I thought. I went over to Nike UK site and after 45 minutes wait I got nowhere with customer service. I was told they must be the wrong size and that it wasn’t a fault with the bra. Really how do they know that for sure when I’ve got two bras in the same size and now one is looser and baggier than the other?!I was told I  couldn’t return them after they’d been worn and washed So you can’t wear and wash something and if it develops a fault you’re stuck with it. Non existent customer service. Of all the items I’ve bought which is extensive and being a loyal customer I’d only had to contact customer service twice. I’m not a complainer and rarely use a customer service to complain about faults. On both occasions NIKE UK have failed me as a customer miserably. Sadly I will no longer purchasing from Nike. I expected more from such a large company. If you’re an American customer though you’re given the red carpet treatment. The disdain for the UK customer was as clear as to me as night and day. I wouldn’t risk buying anything else from Nike. It’s not cheap and I expected so much more. ,2024-09-30T19:35:04.000Z,Nike
"Hi, Unhappy Consumer ",Oh So Diamond,3,"Hi,Normally I’m happy with the way Nike resolves issues but in this case I feel like the customer service representatives and the in-Store representative need to get on the same page with returns and exchanges. I had a great deal on a pair of sneakers in which i purchased by was too small. Called to do a return and exchange. I did the return at the store in which the online rep said once i bring it to the store the exchange will process.. WRONG!!! That’s is not what happened. I received a refund and I was told the store should have initiated the exchange. $50 purchase down the drain for the sneakers to be back to $110 and Nike reps say there is both they can do. YES I’m very much not happy.",2024-09-30T19:05:36.000Z,Nike

He opened the box today on his birthday and the shoes are too small. Called customer service, spent 30 minutes on the line and asked them to exchange for a bigger size (we were just 4 days over the official 30 day return period). The answer was NO. I was not asking for my money back, just wanted to exchange for a bigger size and was willing to pay for postage. REALLY!!!! The company that makes millions can not exchange a pair of shoes for a 13 year old child on his birthday! P.S. later the same date we came to Nike O2 store in London, explained the situation, and a very nice and polite gentleman at the till accepted the shoes and issued us with a refund with the words “no problem, things happen!” ",2024-09-28T13:16:09.000Z,Nike

What warranty?!,Noelia Ramos,1,Nike supposedly has a two year warranty but it starts when the shoe was manufactured not when you purchased it. Basically you can buy a pair today and they could be falling apart 6 months later and they will not honor the warranty if it was made over 2 years ago.How am I to know as a consumer when the shoe was manufactured? I can tell you when I purchased it how much it cost and that it's defective.

I done this and they arrived and still had the same problem. I again sent them back and spoke to someone through the live chat and they were useless.

I spoke to someone again who said there’s nothing they can do as someone previously had given me an American discount code.

Sent 4 items back in 1 box only refunded for 1 item and customer service team calling me a liar ,Steven Obergan,1,"I recently made an order of a large number of items as I was given a 25% discount code for my birthday. I ended up returning for items out of a large order. The total of these items was roundabout £350.I waited a week and then found out that Nick had only credited me back for one pair of slides that were a total of £33 I called up customer services to tell them the error and they told me they were make an investigation and will be in touch with me. I waited over two weeks with no response so I called up again and was told the investigation had been completed and that my items have not been received therefore I will not be getting a credit note for the rest of the items When I asked the agent to speak to a manager they outright refused and just stay completely silent when I asked again they remain silent and I said what are my options here I have sent back the items they said you have not sent back the items and basically called me a liar . I am not sure what has changed with customer services but I spend a lot of money with them via the membership app and I was classified as a VIP member. I used to get great customer service from them. It seems like they have moved their customer agents from Ireland to an Eastern European country where they the tone is very, very rude. I’m actually not sure what else to do now so it looks like I have lost out on over £300 if anyone from Nike is reading this your move to Eastern European call centre approach is not working before I wrote this review. I read a number of other reviews which were very similar to this it looks like you are outright not looking after your customers anymore. It is very sad to see as I’m a huge fan of the products.

To be told these are supporting retailers for Nike and to go purchase from them !! I then ask if my discount of 25% would be refunded as a gesture from Nike because from Nike it would be £131 and  other retailers £174.99.. she  replied NO it’s a different retailer to Nike after just being told these for supporting retailers.HOW CAN NIKE WHO ACTUALLY MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCTS BE OUT OF STOCK OT WEEKS..

Terrible shopping experience,Thomas,1,"Story in 3 parts from Poland.1. The buyingI tried to buy the product via their website. Tried, because both payment via google pay and payment by card was rejected (nothing wrong with both payment types as i've just used them slightly earlier and slightly after the attempt). Finally I've gone to the store and bought it there, but their cashier had to use their company phone so i could order the shoes.2. The wearing experienceI tried on these trainers in the shop, weren't perfect but figured they'll adjust eventually. Nope, I was never more wrong in my life. I wore them again the next day, was just wearing different type of socks. After 15 mins it felt as if i'm walking on pins (or stepped on legos). Figured I'll return them when I have time to do so.3. The returnI finally went to the store as I have about a week left before I'm eligible for a return (and a refund). Store is closed temporarily as they're having some kind of refurbishing inside. Can't return it to the store as I was instructed in the receipt (an hour wasted for the trip). Calling support line - occupied. Reached out via chat... whether they offshore their support line or use ""AI"" (not much of an Intelligence though), this was the single worst customer line experience ever. Ready-made answers with no room for discussion from their side or answers that do not really answer my questions. Proceeded with the flow where I would have to pay for the return and I'd be granted a coupon for their products (which I'm no longer interested in, given the lack of comfort I had wearing those trainers), whereas I'm only interested in a return with a charge back to my card. Finally, after another half an hour wasted I got the answer that I can try returning it in a different store, already jumping with joy given today's experience.",2024-09-16T19:53:06.000Z,Nike
Terrible marketing/website and customer service,Alex,1,"As far as buying trainers goes, Nike is usually my number one choice as they USED TO BE good at indicating what materials were used on the shoes. But now the website is absolute trash and just waffles on about the style of the shoe and where the inspiration came from (as if anyone even cares!) and then states  “mixed materials”, whatever that means, or doesn’t even mention what it’s made of at all. It’s infuriating! I want to buy shoes made from ethical fabrics (ie, no skins of innocent animals), which Nike used to make me feel confident in, but now it’s anyone’s guess.  Even their colleagues on the chat don’t fill you with confidence as they don’t give a clear answer.

My daughter spotted of white Air Force 1 that that was in a torn box against the wall that was the claimed clearance dept. that day they offered these sneakers for 30% off well we decided to leave the store because the prices where more then the online store. So we waited on this long to pay and leave. SYD z cashier person at the register was so angry l was ready to pay for my item but it seemed to be miss marked. Placed in the clearance wall. But there were many other AG1in the rip and torn boxes. Well anyways at the register the girl with the bad attitude tells me they aren’t on sale. So these shoes were in the clearance rack and no nobody gets anything off. So I said that makes no sense if the item is on a clean e rack it should be included. There were multiple pair of the shoe on the rack. So demanded to speak to a manger. This manger was not a nice person at all rolled her eyes at me like I’m a pain in the ass. But it’s the principal. The manger went to another manger to investigate the order and saw there were others there so they honored the 30%. So we got lucky. We got lucky according to some reviews so basically everyone there has a major attitude problem. They don’t look at you or speak to you. I’m never going back to that store.

I do 100% of my shopping online from at least 30 different retailers and this one by far has been the worst and most frustrating shopping experience I have ever faced.

I have had three separate contacts with their customer service and despite the fact that they confirmed a refund has been processed and it should be processed in a few days, I am still waiting for nearly two month. It is very obvious that they are utterly incompetent and incapable as they cannot even refer you to a higher department. Another thing, The email address they gave to me to file a complaint is non-existent. I found their UK branch CEO email address and sent her a direct email, to which, I am still waiting for a reply.I am completely hopeless and have a feeling that they are going to steal my money and never come back to me.

Awful,Tommy,1,Awful service and non-existent communication. I ordered a pair of socks on 21 August for collection. Although I tried several times it was not possible to track them as I kept receiving an error message. On 29 August I spoke to a virtual assistant who told me that the order had been delivered and assured me that it was still available to be collected. I had not received any updates as to the status of my order.The following day I went to the shop (Co-Op) and was told by staff that I needed a QR code to collect a delivery (which I did not have). I finally got them to check and lo and behold my package was not there. After getting home I called customer service and was told that the package was not delivered and was returned to sender – so the virtual assistant had lied! Just a terrible ordeal from start to finish. Avoid.,2024-09-02T21:09:16.000Z,Nike

Went onto Nike chat. Was told order hadnt even been processed. No major apology or offer of refund. Was told they have to wait 5 days after the expected delivery day before they can do anything. Asked can I chat to a manager or make a formal complaint. Was told they I couldnt and they dont have a complaints dept. I thne went onto their chat again that day asking can I cancel the order (as it hadnt even been processed). Told they have to wait the 5 days after the expected delivery date. Rang them by phone this morning. On hold for 20 mins. Trainers still hadnt left the warehouse. Told a refund will be processed in 3 working days all going well!

DO NOT BUY FROM NIKE!!,Victoria,1,"DO NOT BUY FROM NIKE!!! Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing! bought my daughter some trainers, did not fit so returned and bought a size bigger. Waited around 1 month for the refund- did not arrive. Contacted Nike and they advised the wrong item had been delivered. I advised I had 100% sent the right trainers. Nike assistant told me he would investigate and contact me in 5 days. 1 month later I called and advised they are still investigating. I then had a parcel turn up at my door which was an old pair of guess shoes I had never seen before. I also did not receive any call from Nike to advise they would be sending me this item. Called again and was told this is what they received and this would have to be escalated again. I am not sure if Nike are extremely unlucky with their returns and somehow everyone's items go missing or if they just have very incompetent staff who seem to mess this up their end however I retuned my item 2 months ago and am no closer to receiving my money back. I strongly urge people to read the reviews here before purchasing from Nike as if I had I would have saved myself the stress and not bothered to buy from them. I will not be buying from them again and I urge others not too. Disgusting customer service and no way of resolving your problems, as you just seem to get 'nothing we can do' attitude.

I have been a loyal member since 2017, and it is disheartening to encounter ongoing problems that hinder my ability to make purchases.This is not the first time I have faced these issues. Despite numerous attempts, including using various credit cards such as Capital One, Credit One, Chase, Navy Federal, and USAA American Express, I continue to receive errors. I even tried using my mother's card, addressing the potential issue of mismatched billing and shipping names/addresses. Additionally, I attempted to purchase a gift card, but after a successful payment, I received an email cancelling the order.With today's technology advancements, such simple errors should not be occurring.

No limit on the amount of shoes allowed to be purchased,Margret,1,"It's a damn shame I can't even order a pair of shoes within 24 hours of it coming out because clearly there is no limit to the amount of pairs allowed to be bought at one time.  I just learned about Stock X... so if you're not sitting at the computer waiting for the shoe to ""drop"" you're not getting a pair unless you're willing to pay at least $50 extra from what Nike was charging.  I wanted the Jordan Retro 4's in the white thunder.  I went on Nike.com the DAY they were released and not a pair in site.  But guess where they were being sold when I googled the shoe... Stock X!  Already listed when you know there's no possible way the seller has the shoes already.  That's probably the reason my sons shoes wont be here before school starts... because the world has turned into a ""resell"" shop.  Makes me not even want to buy nike at all any more.Why would Nike care?  As long as they're making their money on them, it doesn't concern them.  But when I have a 14 year old son who wears a 14 in men's, I'm now forced to pay more than DOUBLE what the shoe costs on Nike's website because money hungry people buy them all up to resell.

I provided a video of the promotion message offering the nike by you products but they say it does not apply because it out of the promotion policies.

Disappointed…,Tesla,2,"Have issues with order C01424851498. Bought a pair of shoes as a gift to someone from Canada, the shoes were left outside in front of of the house not in a bag as they used to. Rained a lot, they got wet and smelly, found out about this upon the gift receiver from Canada opened them up. Could not return them due to the circumstances, and Nike only refunded the shipping charges. I understand it’s my problem I can’t return them, but still ended up with a pair of smelly wet shoes but paid for new in impeccable state. Amazon would just refund the whole thing ($70), Nike decided it was not worth it for just one customer and a bad review.",2024-08-12T20:32:22.000Z,Nike

Delivering to collection point carries charge,Kathryn Smith,1,Ordered shoes at Nike USA while on holiday. Asked to be delivered to local store that they suggested. Paid $8 for shipping and handling. Went to collect and was told I needed to pay an additional $20 for a holding fee. This seemed outrageous as this was not mentioned when placing the order. $20 seems very high charge to hold a shoebox for less than 24 hours as well.

I then purchased a 3rd pair of trainers and when I received the 3rd pair I opened the box and all around the soles you could see excessive amount of white glue and someone had scratched the number 13 with a sharp object on the bottom of the trainers. At this point I was really fed up so I lodged a complaint with Nike only to be offered a 20% discount off my next purchase. I was insulted by Nikes offer as I can get 20% discount codes offline myself,  I then decided to lodge my complaint through Resolver.

I've bought Nike Air Revolution recently, worn them twice and the click developed. I then bought the Nike Alpha 5 trainer as they had no air bubble and thought they'd be OK. 2 wears in and the left trainer is now clicking. What is going on?? I sent the second pair back and thought they might replace them, however it appears on their tests that there is no manufacturing fault???!!I now have 2 new pairs of very, very expensive gardening trainers and nowhere to go.

Worst customer service in the world!,Fenn Wilson,1,"The issue that I have experienced was: I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the customer service I have received from your company. As a long-time Nike customer, I am appalled by the unprofessional and substandard assistance provided by your support team. The following points outline the specific issues I have encountered, which I believe are entirely unacceptable for a company of Nike's stature:Lack of Proper English: Several of your customer service agents have demonstrated a poor command of the English language. This has resulted in miscommunications and an inability to effectively address my concerns. Clear and professional communication should be a basic requirement for any customer service representative.Chats Ended Prematurely: On multiple occasions, your agents have ended my chats without answering my questions or resolving my issues. This abrupt and discourteous behavior is extremely frustrating and indicative of a lack of proper training and customer care.Unwillingness to Help: There have been instances where the agents seemed entirely unwilling to assist me. Rather than providing solutions or attempting to understand my problem, they often deflected my questions and ended the conversation prematurely. This attitude is unacceptable and reflects poorly on Nike's commitment to customer satisfaction.Contradictory Information: I have been told by one advisor that the information I provided was incorrect, only to be informed by another advisor that it was indeed correct. This inconsistency is confusing and suggests a serious lack of internal communication and knowledge among your staff.Multiple Agents for One Issue: It took interactions with four different chat agents before my problem was even acknowledged, let alone addressed. This unnecessary repetition and lack of continuity are highly inefficient and frustrating for customers who simply want their issues resolved in a timely manner.Misleading Information Regarding Warranty Claims: The information provided to me regarding my warranty claim was confusing and often contradictory. This led to significant delays and additional frustration on my part. Accurate and clear information is essential for customers to understand and navigate warranty claims effectively.Lack of Basic Manners and Care: The majority of the agents I interacted with displayed a complete lack of basic manners and empathy. A courteous and caring attitude is fundamental to good customer service, and it is disappointing to see this lacking in your support team.In light of these issues, I urge Nike to seriously reconsider the training and standards applied to your customer service team. I expect a company of your reputation to prioritize customer satisfaction and provide professional, efficient, and courteous service. I hope to see immediate improvements in these areas and a resolution to my ongoing issue.",2024-07-24T18:05:24.000Z,Nike

J'ai donc décidé de les retourner quelques jours après réception du colis, profitant de mon droit de retour. Nike m'a fourni un QR code pour le retour via Mondial Relay. Le responsable du point de livraison m'a indiqué une possible erreur sur l'étiquette retour, qui mentionnait un poids de colis de 0,01 kg. Il m'a suggéré de prendre une photo de l'étiquette, mais j'ai fait confiance à Nike et ai renvoyé le colis.Le 28 juin, Mondial Relay m'informe que le colis a bien été livré à destination. Cependant, je n'ai reçu aucune nouvelle de Nike. Après avoir contacté leur service client, j'ai été informé qu'un ticket avait été levé auprès d'une équipe senior. Dix jours plus tard, sans nouvelles, je les recontacte et on me dit que l'article reçu ne correspondait pas à l'article attendu. Ils refusent de me rembourser et mettent fin à la conversation sans plus d'explications.

Service client inacceptable !Review in EnglishI am extremely disappointed with my experience with Nike. In June, I ordered a pair of shoes that I did not like. A few days after receiving the package, I decided to return them, taking advantage of my right to return. Nike provided me with a QR code for the return via Mondial Relay.

Disappointing Customer Service,Hossein,1,"Disappointing Customer Service ExperienceI recently purchased a pair of Nike SB shoes from a store in Montreal, hoping to enjoy their quality and durability. Unfortunately, after an accidental incident where someone stepped on my shoes, they got dirty. I purchased a foam cleaner from the same store, believing it would help clean them. However, despite multiple attempts, the cleaner only seemed to spread the dirt and left one shoe a different color from the other.When I reached out to Nike for assistance, I was directed to contact a specific number for support. Despite calling during business hours multiple times, I was met with an automated message stating that their offices were closed. This lack of availability to address customer concerns is highly disappointing and frustrating.As a loyal customer who has always trusted Nike for quality products, this experience has left me disillusioned. The inability to receive proper support when facing an issue with their product is unacceptable.I hope Nike can improve their customer service accessibility and responsiveness so that others do not encounter similar challenges in the future.",2024-07-09T04:23:51.000Z,Nike

It's an embarrassment and frankly should be considered fraud as they know they're selling junk for $85 a pop.On the other hand, while Nike isn't willing to spend its resources providing a worthwhile product, they have endless amounts of money to preach to their customers while promoting a hateful and divisive political agenda.

I have 3 teenage daughters who have the Air Force, Dunks, 95’s, Pegasus, Zoom and 270’s. We purchase 12-15 pairs of Nikes each year.

Completely incompetent and impossible to speak to.,rick_x,1,"Completely incompetent and had to threaten them with a credit card chargeback to get anything done. Beware, despite being a billion dollar company, none of this is spent on customer service or logistics. I ordered the new England kit for my sons birthday and added a number and his name. Delivery was supposed to be in 7 days giving me a 1 day buffer. 2 days before it should have come I get an email saying it has been 'delayed'. Nothing more. Frantically I try to speak to a human being only to get bots and nonsense and finally when I do speak to someone they tell me, 'you need to wait', no explanation of what the problem is or a delivery update, just 'wait' and that 'we have no way to communicate with the warehouse'. The promised delivery date comes and goes with no change so I tell them I need to cancel as they've let me down and I get told I can't. Several hours of trying to speak to a person who has understands the situation is wasted before I threaten to do a credit card chargeback and they agree to cancel, telling me I'll get a confirmation by email (I record the chat transcript). The email never comes and I go out and buy my son the kit, on his birthday. A week and a half later I get confirmation my order is on its way. Cue another hour long chat with CS at which point they tell me I can send it back. I tell them if it comes they have a choice, give it to me for free or collect one evening on a day of my choice, if not there's going to be a chargeback. Amazing how they get their act together when it will cost them money. Given the circumstances any decent company would have apologised (they didn't) and just said keep the shirt for your trouble.

Last time I’ll purchase any Nike product ,Shomary ,1,Bought two pairs of runners for my daughters (6&10) & they are the worst quality of any brand I have ever purchased. Fabric filthy after only a few wears & impossible to clean due to mesh fabric. Already worn in other places. I used to think they were a top quality brand; seems the quality has deteriorated by 100% but the price has increased the same amount. ,2024-06-12T22:27:44.000Z,Nike
Such poor customer service,Ciara O Brien,1,Such poor customer service. Ordered trainers - got notification they were out of stock. Turns out after this happening again that it was due to incorrect eircode despite it on the delivery address confirmation. Was reassured this  would not happen again & Nike assist would monitor order and ensure I got my order. 2 days later order not fulfilled due to same issue - despite follow up emails - nothing !! Their agents are unfort quite rude and would not recommend them to anyone. ,2024-06-12T19:38:45.000Z,Nike
"Hi my name is Ryan,",Ryan,1,"Hi my name is Ryan,I have neurological disabilities and need my carer to accompany me when shopping.I purchased a size 8 flip flop and when returning home opened the box to find 1 shoe and it was a size 10!!My carer has other patients in the area to see that day so couldn’t return me to the store so due to my anxiety and stress regarding this situation I decided to take a taxi back on the day to resolve the matter where I was met with total stubbornness by the female member off staff and she basically said “oops sorry” but because I struggle with communication skills and mixing with people I just got my refund and returned home ASAP. I rang the store to complain and spoke to the manager Avesta who said he would deal with this situation and email me in the next hour.I never received an email an for 3 weeks couldn’t contact the store via the land line number on google.When I did reach Avesta he said he had miss wrote my email address and  could offer me 10% off my next purchase which I wasn’t happy with as I have been shopping with Nike for years and an ex athlete who suffered a brain injury. I Explained to him I feel let down and not taken seriously due to my illness people over look me and sometimes feel invisible.I asked him to escalate the matter with his seniors and see what they could do for me as I can’t make it into store after a series off seizures I recently taken into hospital.Unfortunately I wasn’t important enough for Nike to offer me any other alternative solutions to resolve my bad experience and he said that he had tried but it has came from his seniors.I am so disappointed in the way this world wide brand treat neurologically challenged ex athletes.Won’t be shopping with Nike. Until they make some changes for people who have non visible disabilities. :( Ryan-Leeds Roberts   ",2024-06-12T16:08:28.000Z,Nike

After chatting to customer service agent about why not receiving it he discloses that the promo is 25% but that ""not all customers get it"", and since I don't receive the newsletters I don't receive it, but he can offer me 10% (later increased it to 15%). After 10 years of membership and buying lots and lots of product (despite not receiving any advertisement - talk about a loyal customer!) this is how Nike values their customers and manages to create memory associations into key moments in customer's lives.

I bought a pair of Jordans from Nike…,Kaylum Gayle,1,"I bought a pair of Jordans from Nike online store and my trainers was stolen by an Evri courier. Nike still use Evri despite their reputation for being the worst carrier service in Britain for theft. Nike are a well established company and it seems that they do not care much for their reputation as I have viewed numerous complaints and warnings after my situation involving Nike and Evri. For a company that is worth £123.9 billion using not only the cheapest courier but a thieving one that is damaging your reputation, stealing from your customers and stealing from your company should be enough to make the CEO/chairmen of Nike feel absolutely embarrassed. If you cannot do better, please leave it to retailers who have pride in their companies that can afford to use reputable carrier services such as Royal Mail, FedEx and Parcel Force to deliver their goods. Whoever is the head of Nike's delivery remit needs the sack the department needs to be sack. I was refunded for the trainers but not the delivery and was given a 20% discount for my next purchase, to be robbed again No Thanks!!!. I would have rather had my Jordan’s and yes I’m sure the courier who stole them is having a great Nike experience wearing them or sold it absolute p*ss take.

Extremely Disappointed with Nike's Service and Product Quality,Shaquille,1,"I am writing to express my utter dissatisfaction with my recent experience with Nike. On July 1st, 2023, I purchased a pair of LeBron 20 shoes, expecting the premium quality that Nike is reputed for. However, within just three months, a swollen bump appeared beneath the left shoe, which is something I have never experienced with any footwear before.Two months later, while playing indoor basketball, the bump punctured, causing an audible escape of air with every step. Given that the shoes were still within the manufacturing date, I sent them back to Nike for inspection, hoping for a fair resolution.To my dismay, I received a response stating, ""We have received your claim product and after a thorough inspection, we've determined the issue with the Airbag is a result of contact with a sharp foreign object. This is not a material or manufacturing fault per our returns guidelines, and we're unable to issue a replacement product. We're returning your item to you.""This is utterly unfair and unacceptable. I paid over $300 for these shoes, expecting durability and quality. Instead, I received a defective product that Nike refuses to take responsibility for. It is beyond disappointing to be blamed for a manufacturing flaw.I am boycotting Nike and will be sharing my negative experience with others. I have never spent so much on a pair of shoes, and this incident has taught me a valuable lesson. Nike's handling of this situation has been unprofessional and disheartening, and I will not be purchasing from your company again.",2024-06-03T21:50:54.000Z,Nike
Exchanges are pointless!,Jm,1,"Ordered a pair of shoes for my 3 year old son and they were too small. So I called, as stated, and started an exchange.

It’s been over a month and I just spoke via chat support about getting my refund. I saw that the exchange was canceled last week because it has now taken so long that his new size has sold out. The warehouse they were sent back to has horrible reviews and seems sketchy. I was not notified about my return or exchange being canceled. Most companies send your exchange after they’ve received the old return and this warehouse had my shoes for weeks.

I tried on chat to get help, was answered and ignored twice by someone (bot) claiming to be named Riyselle. I got someone on the phone today and they told me it was cancelled because my address didnt match my credit card info. I just checked it. The info I entered was 100% correct. Nike is the problem. Now I have to go to a store and buy a gift card and drive it to the coaches house. This is a little embarrassing and a total pain. FU nike. ",2024-05-20T23:43:34.000Z,Nike

"Dear Nike, please stop using Evri",Anonymous,2,"I ordered a Travis Scott t-shirt using Nike's SNKRS service after waking up early to get it. It was dispatched to Evri for delivery, which they received on the 2nd of May. As of the 18th of May I have yet to receive it. On the 6th of May I called Nike to ask them if they are aware of where the parcel is, with the customer service caller telling me that the product was most likely stolen by the Evri warehouse workers. They had stated they had many cases of missing parcels with Evri and were looking into it, and therefore issued an immediate refund. While I appreciated the immediate refund and the services offered to facilitate this, this is not good enough. If as a company you are aware of your delivery provider potentially stealing the goods you sell, it should be in your best interests as well as the customers you claim to care about to immediately cut ties with them and work with another delivery provider in order to actually profit from the drop. Furthermore, there should be more stock of the goods sold kept behind in case of a situation such as this. Overall, I have no problem with Nike, but I absolutely have a problem with the choice of delivery provider. They have clearly chosen them due to how cheap the service is, but this comes at a great cost to your service, quality and reliability. I really want to buy the next Travis Scott shoe, but knowing my parcel would be at the mercy of Evri's warehouse workers I sense that it will end up as a pointless endeavour to no reward despite how sought after they are. Please never use Evri again!",2024-05-18T18:37:06.000Z,Nike
Nike wouldn’t do anything after DPD…,Tony,1,Nike wouldn’t do anything after DPD decided to return back my order to nike after 1 attempt to deliver and without giving me any chance to choose another delivery option.

Took them back to the Nike Town store in Oxford St (where I bought them) according to this policy on Nike’s official website. First the store manager told me I was as on the wrong website. What? Is there any other website? Then I was told that apparently I need to call some random phone number, wait for 30mins listening to classical music, then argue my case, then maybe I’ll be sent a return label, so then I’ll need to find a box and go to the post office to send them back to some random warehouse and maybe after a few months, if it is determined that there was a fault, Nike might refund me.

Then it cuts off after their ‘inactivity’ and gives you to another advisor who does EXACTLY the same thing.  So you spend the whole time there talking to yourself.

Somewhat disingenuous costumer service,TD,1,"I ordered some items for a birthday present for my son's friend, with a Nike members discount offer. The items were damaged in transit so were not delivered by courier company. Which meant the little boy did not get his presents in time. It took a few emails to chase up with Nike. Eventually they refunded and suggested I place a new order. They offered a small discount on the re-order as compensation, but this can only claimed later after the full price was paid online. However, I'd pointed out even with the discount offered,  I would still end up paying more than originally (as the Nike members discount offer expired). They then said they they would match the original price in the refund - ie. ignore that fact they initially suggested offer some compensation. But then would not process the refund until I chased up several times. At the same time I am getting emails saying ""we value you as a costumer and your understanding"" etc. It's the principle of it that matters.

Although I usually read reviews before ordering from lesser-known companies, I didn't think I needed to do so for Nike. I placed an order for two pairs of shoes through the official Nike app for a total of £168. The next day, I was provided with a tracking number, but it didn't show any delivery information or the delivery company responsible for my parcel. As time went by, I grew increasingly concerned and checked the app regularly for updates. However, I didn't receive any updates until I received an email stating that they had refunded my order without any explanation. When I contacted Nike, they informed me that the delivery company, DPD, had been unable to deliver my parcel - although I was at home the entire time and had received no attempted delivery notifications. I was disappointed as I had been looking forward to wearing these shoes to a special event. When I asked Nike to redeliver my order, they told me that I would have to place a new order and pay again. However, I had already lost trust in them, and I didn't want to risk experiencing the same issue again.

Such a poor experience,Tim Jones,1,"Such a poor experience. Still awaiting refund for non delivery of goods.Order placed on 21/4/2024. I was informed it was dispatched 22/4 then informed of a problem on 23/4. Then nothing. I contacted dpd on 26/4 to be informed they’d lost my order and the d need to contact Nike for a refund. I did and was informed a refund had been raised back to my account. By 7/5 if still not received my refund so again contacted Nike. They confirmed it hadn’t been raised and again stated they would raise refund and it would be returned within 9 days. At this point no one from Nike or DpD has offered an apology for the non delivery and my poor experience. So I asked if gesture of goodwill would be appropriate given the failure to deliver and failure to process the refund. They offered a 10% code. I pointed out 10% bearly covered their delivery charge. Brick wall. I was then informed they don’t charge delivery IF you're a member. I explained I wasn’t, and given my experience AND no apology thought 10% was pretty poor, especially as I’d still not received a refund. The colleague said he had refunded it. I pointed out I’d been told this before and the refund had only been raised today because I had chased it. The Nike colleague was then rather aggressive and rude in their chat. I rejected to 10% as this isn’t a company I want to give future business to after this experience. I will update when/if my refund ever transpires.

Recieved a destroyed product,Velic,1,"Recieved a destroyed product. Best nike can do is discount on next purchase.For my birthday my girl ordered an authentic Liverpool shirt.

That shirt costs €150,-But it's a present and better yet I wanted one with my last name and 24 on the back because this is the year I become a father.However the custom print wasn't able for some reason so she ordered one without printing and we could print it on later.Well look at the phote and you'll understand my sadness and disappointment.I received a completely ruined shirt. First of all the printing is from a youth player so it's not even a good number/name. Second of all the printing isn't even done correctly. By the official nike store. As you can see, the 8 came already creased and literally loose on one side. The 4 has an horrible crease inside it. I mean what do they expect me to do with this. I can't return it because the shirt is sold out.You can't expect a customer to pay €150 for a shirt that's damaged and offer a discount on the next purchase.Even if I can remove the printing without leaving any damage or visible marks, this is not what a €150 shirt should look like.

Disappointing Experience with Personalized England Kit from Nike,Leah Graham,1,"I recently purchased a personalised England kit from Nike for my son, but the experience left much to be desired. Despite paying for personalisation, the order was delayed, and upon arrival, the box was severely damaged. Worse still, the personalisation on the football shirt was poorly done, with the letter 'A' partially missing from the wording.Upon contacting Nike to complain, I was met with a disappointing response. They offered the option to return the parcel, wait for it to be received, and then wait even longer for a full refund—hardly acceptable when my son needed the shirt for an upcoming event. Their alternative was a mere 20% discount, amounting to £14.00, issued as a voucher for future purchases on their website. This offer seemed paltry considering the £70 spent on the kit.What's more, the lack of empathy and understanding from the staff only exacerbated the situation. As a billion-dollar global brand, Nike should prioritize customer satisfaction, especially for everyday consumers who rely on their products. The absence of an apology or a proactive solution, such as collecting the defective kit, was truly disappointing.In conclusion, Nike's handling of this situation was nothing short of dcsisgraceful. For a company that sponsors celebrities and sports teams, they must do better by their regular customers, who cannot afford to endure such inconvenience and disappointment.",2024-05-04T16:39:47.000Z,Nike

Awful Customer Service,Arabelle R,1,"I received a product that was not the same as the photo. The team member offered me 10% if I wanted to keep the bottle. I told them that my son was disappointed as he wanted the product as shown on the picture. The team member told me to return this product and they will send me new product. They sent me a return label however I told them I do not have a printer and I asked if this can be printed at the postcode office. They said yes. When I received the email it did not show any options of printing at the post office, so I spoke to the chat team again and explained if they can send me a barcode as I did not have a printer for the label. They told me there is no other option but to print the label and advised me that I can go to the library and print it.Why should I go waste my time to go and print a label when it was not my fault Nike sent a product that was not the same as the product image. Also my son had to wait another few days for another product to arrive.This is shameful for their customer service team to advise their customers this way! Also they dispatched the exchanged product using royal mail to a pick up location as if it is my own home address. I assumed the person who did the exchange will resend it the exact same way I ordered it, not presume the pick up shop is my home address! They did not confirm my address with me.I had issues collecting my order from the shop as I did not have any pick up pass.I tried to submit a complaint to them on the chat and they just closed the chat.

I tried to return them to the Nike store in Chinook Mall but ALL PURCHASES TO CROSSIRON must be returned to that store (because they aren't affiliated) which is inconvenient. I wouldn't have purchased them at all had I known that since I live in Bragg Creek area. I called and Trevor (sales associate) said they'd send me a mailing label so I wouldn't have to pay for return shipping. The store received the shorts on April 6, 2024 and they still haven't refunded me the money.I would seriously reconsider shopping at this store unless you live in the NE or often frequent this store as returns and customer service are TERRIBLE.",2024-04-16T16:37:48.000Z,Nike

I purchased the Air Jordan 14 Retro Flint grey on 03/21/2024 and was suppose to arrive on the 25th. We it didn't I checked tracking and the only thing it showed was label created. Talked  to customer service and was informed UPS had package because they only bill your card when it shipped and my card was charged. Was told to give it a few more days which I did. A few days later same tracking, label created. I call customer service again and ask for a supervisor to get to bottom of shipping problem. Jackie was the supervisor, what a joke, Nike must promote the highest level of incompetency. Jackies answer, we can give you a refund because the shoe is now out of stock. I asked when they would be in stock, she said no idea and they might not be. I asked her to call UPS location to find out the problem and she refused. Then asked her what UPS location they were suppose to be located. She didn't want to say but I insisted and got a half A answer of Adapt MI that she guessed was Mississippi. Obviously there are thieves either at Nike or UPS.   With supervisors like Jackie Im sure Nike is getting  getting robbed blind. Makes perfect sense that Nike sprice on stock market is way down. Employees like Jackie will run any company in the ground. I wouldn't hire her to walk a dog. SMDH",2024-03-28T23:52:56.000Z,Nike

Do not buy NIKE gift cards,Amy,1,"Do not buy NIKE gift cards. We received four Nike $100 gift cards for Christmas that were purchased from Walgreens. These cards were printed with insufficient PIN numbers, per the NIKE outlet manager. The manager confirmed the balance, and said that we should call the 800 number and Nike would either re-issue the cards or provide an adequate PIN number in order to use the cards. Nike refused to honor gift cards and frauduantly zeroed the balance in order to do so. They said that the cards were used. This statement is inconsistent with the statement from the outlet manager, who said that the cards could not be used as issued, with only 4 numbers for the PIN. When pressed beyond the canned response about not being able to do anything for cards with a zero balance, they falsely reported that one of the cards was used at a store in the Bronx in December 2023. That was a fraudulent statement because the card was physically 1300 miles from there at that time. When I stated this inconsistency and asked for documentation of each card's alleged usage, they refused to disclose the information on the other two cards and would put nothing in writing. The customer service rep stated that I must go to local police and NIKE would provide information only if they received a subpeona.This dishonest business practice of refusing to honor gift cards by erasing the balance must be a standard operating procedure at Nike.

The service provided was cold and heartless, leading to a thoroughly disappointing experience.From the moment I stepped into the store, it was evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority. Avesta, the manager on duty, displayed a lack of empathy and failed to address my concerns adequately, leaving me feeling unheard and unappreciated as a customer.The overall atmosphere in the store felt tense, and it was disheartening to experience such a lack of professionalism from someone in a managerial position. Avesta's approach to customer service fell far short of the standards I expect from a brand as reputable as Nike.I believe that providing constructive feedback is crucial for improvement. I sincerely hope that Nike takes steps to address these issues, ensuring a more positive experience for future customers. Nike has a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and my encounter with Avesta was a disappointing departure from that expectation.I encourage Nike to invest in customer service training and create a more welcoming environment for patrons. As a loyal customer, I hope to witness positive changes in the service provided at this location in the future.This feedback is shared with the intention of contributing to the improvement of customer experiences at Nike, and I trust that steps will be taken to rectify these concerns.",2024-02-27T15:10:08.000Z,Nike

Needed smaller sizes but staff were in groups chatting to each other and very hard to get their attention. I gave up and left vowing never to go back. I ended up getting some Adidas trainers which are great. Not sure if I’ll buy Nike again as my purchases keep people like that in a job! Very bad experience, Nike you make big bucks so get your act together.",2024-02-18T20:58:41.000Z,Nike

Nike’s cancel culture practices,Gary Newman,1,"About Christmas time 2023, I became aware of Nike’s cancel culture behavior within their internet advertising. It’s overtly obvious! I was shopping for new running shoes and like their light weight, but expensive shoes I first purchased about 2-3 years ago. I settled on ASIC’s 7.4oz Metaspeed Edge men’s size 11 and very happy with them. I will NO longer purchase any Nike products of any type and advised my family members to boycott Nike as well!",2024-02-18T17:04:13.000Z,Nike
Had to raise a chargeback via the…,Consumer,1,"Had to raise a chargeback via the credit card company against Nike today for an incorrect refund, attempted several time to discuss this with Nike directly, but each time the online person ended the chat or received emails from them contradicting themselves. It will cost Nike more to process the charge back claim from Amex than it would for them to rectify the issue. The over charge is £15, I’ve already used the online complaints 3 times as well as a phone call, I’ve downloaded the transcript from today and would upload it here as proof if there was an option! Now their finance team will have to trawl back through paperwork and orders etc. I’ve found the UK FD on LinkedIn so will drop him an email with the details.",2024-02-18T11:36:00.000Z,Nike

All round hassle in every way.,ellen fordham,1,"Must remember to not do Christmas shopping with this company. Start shopping early so you can hopefully grab it before it goes out of stock, but then if it doesn’t fit, and that’s more often than not with Nike sizing, you can’t return it because it’s gone over their returns duration, even though they’re still selling the items on line. Also can guarantee you have to chase a refund when you return an item. 3 weeks been waiting, and tracking says they have had it for weeks. Have had an account and been a good customer of Nike for a long time but their customer service is truly shocking.",2024-02-18T01:33:50.000Z,Nike

Apparently my issue was escalated and I would hear back. 48 hours later, heard nothing.

However, my interactions, particularly with an individual named Seco, have been characterized by rudeness and a lack of professionalism. I have provided evidence of the shipment and its reception, including the parcel's weight indicated on the receipt. Despite this, the company has been unable to locate the parcel or is claiming that it arrived empty. Such treatment of customers is unacceptable for a reputable company. As of February 14th, I am still engaged in efforts to obtain my refund, which is deeply disappointing and frustrating.

Website needs improving,Gonçalo Gomes,3,"I want to make this clear it is purely about the experience today with the website and phone support. Tried to purchase 2 pairs of shoes, at checkout I ended up getting all sorts of errors, despite choosing different payment methods (paypal, google pay) - the error did have a phone number which was actually a smart thing to include. Getting through to an operator was less than an easy task. I understand the more info you have, the speedier you get the operator to help us and more efficient your support is, but having a robot trying to ""note down"" my name, was anything but a easy task. In the end, I gave up and used John Smith. After that, I was quite fast speaking to Radha in India, who was polite and knowledgeable, but unfortunately, I could barely hear word and had to ask her to repeat herself countless times. Please improve the experience. Furthermore, the solution was to install the app or wait 24 hours, which I was reluctant to do, but in the end, turned out to be quite an easy option, but alas, on install the app forces you to offer marketing information, which is another downside. In fairness, I was pleasantly surprised the checkout was still filled from the website to the app based on my username, so that was what made this a 3 star rather than a 2.",2024-02-03T14:51:48.000Z,Nike

I first tried to get a reason why my order was cancelled by using an online chat. Was asked “what are we getting after?” What language is that??! Offended by this language whatever it is. Train your employees better!! Asked to speak to a manager a number of times on the phone and they just wouldn’t connect me! Was advised I would hear back but just received an email addressing the order and not the offensive language in the chat. Kept sending emails but NO addressing of my issue. Tried to contact the CEO’s office but no luck. Not even an apology! If I didn’t want to disappoint my grandson, I would not have placed the order again. Will not buy Nike in the future for sure.

You may never receive your order,Elaine Nolan,3,"They use couriers that don't deliver items to doors. I bought an item online (€169 retail value). DPD were Nike.com's chosen courier. The courier left the parcel at the gate, on a main road, in full view of everyone passing by, and so open to theft, which does happen, as confirmed by a local postwoman. For this reason, I would not order from Nike.com online again. I raised the issue with DPD by email and never received a reply. I just called Nike customer service and there wasn't an option to escalate this to someone in a position to prevent it happening to other customers. In short; if you order from Nike.com, you are at risk of not receiving your parcel because their chosen courier will leave the parcel in an exposed location at high risk of theft, as opposed to delivering to a door like they're supposed to. High value items should require a signature on delivery.",2024-01-11T18:14:18.000Z,Nike

The returns process is abysmal,Bob,1,"The returns process is abysmal. Almost like its been designed to be clunky so that you miss the return date.First, if you have multiple items from a single order, these have to be returned separately. There's no way to bundle them into a single return. Even though Nike ask ""please use the original packaging iof possible"". But you can't because if you return 2 of 3 items you bought, then each item has to be returned as a separate item, a separate return reference and a separate parcel.When they say 'Collect+"" what they really mean is ""Yodel"".. You search for your ""Collect+ drop off location"", and when you get there, they refuse the parcel because there is a tiny marker on the bottom saying ""Yodel""..Why they don't just have a link to 'Search for your Yodel drop off"" I don't know.. As I said, likely so that you waste your time returning parcels to a Collect+ drop off point that doesn't accept Yodel.It's 2024, Internet shopping has been around for decades, yet Nike seem to have systems that were designed in 1997.. For a multi (hundreds of)-billion $ company it's very poor",2024-01-05T15:34:07.000Z,Nike

I placed 3 orders in total only to have them all cancelled day before expected delivery. I understand the time of year and that stock levels change all the time and some items maybe become unavailable but for such a big brand name I find it very unprofessional for this to be made aware to the customer day before expected delivery. It caused me such stress at an already stressful time of year. Nike need to do better with there app. I can't say I'll never buy the brand again as I have two teenagers at home and it's such a sough after brand.

Complete disaster - AVOID,Jordan,1,"I placed an order via the Nike UK online store on 26th November 2023. The expected arrival date was 30th Nov. On the 30th, I received an e-mail to say that my order was delayed, with no expected delivery date. After 2 weeks, having still not received my order, I got in touch with Nike via online chat and requested my order be cancelled. I was advised the process would take 5-10 days and I would receive a cancellation e-mail in due course. It is now 2nd Jan 2024 - over 5 weeks since my original order. I am still yet to receive a cancellation e-mail or refund for my order.I am quite simply stunned that one of the most internationally recognised and market leading sportswear brands is capable of delivering such a poor customer experience. I understand it’s the busy Christmas period — but to not deliver a product, and then to have to wait 5-10 days until a ‘senior’ member of the team reviews the cancellation request, is beyond me. The process is quite clearly broken and the sheer volume of negative reviews on here should be a major red flag to Nike management.

Racial biases at store,adam levy,1,".I visited the Nike store at Rugby with my partner recently. After browsing, trying on shoes, and deciding against a purchase, we left. To our shock, we were accused of theft by the store's security, insisting on searching our bag containing items purchased elsewhere - sweetcorn and hair gel. Their reason? We didn't initially enter with a bag.The embarrassment and public scrutiny were appalling. We were wrongfully targeted based on racial stereotypes. The only excuse they could give us was that we had a boots bag that we didnt have when we walked in ... must of pulled the shopping out my backside in the store. Not to mention that 90% of other people had shopping bags with them. We have never been involved in criminal activities and felt humiliated by their baseless accusations.This experience was not just upsetting but deeply disappointing in this day and age. I believe the staff urgently needs cultural sensitivity training to eliminate racial biases. My partner and I are law-abiding citizens, and the unjust treatment we received has tarnished our view of the brand",2023-12-23T23:40:41.000Z,Nike

It is now the 23rd and it is still showing on the tracking as ""awaiting carrier pickup"". I contacted their live chat team who just told me they find out what has happened and update me in 48 hours.

I got immediately refunded for a purchase which I did not receive due to inefficiency of the carrier. Only one remark: please change the carrier BRT in Italy, they really are not at Nike standard level.

THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD!!,Dionadam,1,"If i could rate them with 0 i would do it.The worst customer service i have ever seen in my entire life. I order a pair of shoes at 17 december and at 22 december they cancelled the order without my permission. I phone call the customer service to ask why my order got cancelled and they get it back? And they replied that i wasnt at home to pick up the item, meanwhile UPS told me they never received the item from them.I asked them to refund my money back since they decided to borrow my money and they never send the shoes in first place and they told me i have to wait 10 work days to receive my money back. So we talk 20 days in total NIKE borrow my money and who knows in how many people did that aswell. Well done NIKE!!! Worst than banks!!! I didnt want the money i paid back NIKE, all i wanted was the shoes i paid for and you cancelled my order alone without any reason to give me. TLDR: 200 euros shoes never received, NIKE cancelled the order without any reason after 5 days from the order and now i wait for them to refund me in the next 10 work days! Never again.",2023-12-22T22:02:22.000Z,Nike

Missing item - denies responsibility,Amy ,1,"My order was missing one pair of trainers, which I reported and was told that it would need to be looked into.They didn't get back to me after a few weeks, so I had to contact NIKE again for them to tell me it wasn't their problem and that it was delivered, implying I am lying and trying to make a false claim.They said that the weight of the box and shoes matched, which is a pointless defence as the weight of the delivery box was not what was written on the box, so something has gone wrong along the way and now I have no shoes and no money for it.The customer service is poor, there is no way to escalate to a complaints department. The only way they said the managers would review the case again is if I filed a legal complaint. What the hell ?",2023-12-22T14:56:07.000Z,Nike
Disappointing Customer Care,J.,1,"Placed a 3-item order on 12/13 with a 12/20 delivery date, and it hadn't shipped as of 12/21 despite the website saying otherwise;  the website also has 12/20 published as the last date to receive items by 12/24. I initially contacted customer service through the chat and was told to contact the carrier. When I explained that the item hadn't been shipped, I was then told the issue would be escalated, and I could expect a response in 5 to 7 business days. Considering that the order was placed for a Christmas gift, a 5 to 7 business day wait time just to find out what's being done about the order seemed extreme.After ending the chat, I called customer service for a status update and was told that my options were to get a refund or have the item reshipped after the holiday. I was also told then, after the order had been marked as shipped, that an item that I'd purchased was out of stock. I ended up finding a store that had the items in stock to reorder what had been canceled on the unfulfilled order, but it's been a major inconvenience, especially now having to drive +30-miles to pick up the order. It would have been nice if customer service at least offered to locate a store where the items were in stock. Considering how close it is to the holiday, I can understand things being busy and shipping resources limited. My issue is the lack of communication, lack of care/concern, and limited effort to make things right.",2023-12-22T01:18:22.000Z,Nike

BLACK MOULD GROWING INSIDE COATING OF SHOES,Michael,1,"A black mould/fungus has started growing within the outer coating of my nike air max 270 golf shoes.

DO NOT BUY NIKE GOLF SHOES.NOTE1. I have photos that would help readers see the problem. Sadly Trust Pilot do not allow for the posting of photos.2. The positive reviews here of Nike all seem to be written in same style of pretty PR language that would not look out of place on the Nike website.

I received a confirmation email today that the order was being shipped to a pick up point for Wednesday.I eventually found (as Nike don't appear to want to make it easy for you to contact them) and chatted to Nike online. Nike don't give their staff names they are just a ""Nike Athlete"". I explained that a delivery address location had been changed to an unspecified pick up location.Nike Athlete: [sic]Thank you. So, the carrier may have changed this themselves as they may not be able to deliver this to your address. Unfortunately we cannot change this back, but this wont be much longer for you at all.I explained this was disgraceful. I referred to a previous experience with Nike who had delivered my parcel to this address the last time I used this service and I had to go and collect it, got caught in a torrential downpour, nearly got pneumonia.I asked how could they change the delivery address, and to cancel my order and refund me.Nike Athlete: This was the courier Nick, not Nike. The carrier have advised they have changed this to the shop? The carrier must have an issue delivering this to your address and so this is why they changed it. I cannot cancel the order at this stage, but it can be refused at the shop and they will be refunded immediately.I advised that dpd deliver to my area, I wouldn't be going to the shop and so count it as refused. I said how can Nike treat its' customers this way. They should penalise the courier not the customers and I demanded a refund.Nike Athlete: We cant do that until the shop sends this back and it has reached our warehouse. It would be impossible until then. I am unsure why you are saying this, as the courier are the ones who have decided to re-route this parcel, not Nike. Nike did not change this. As advised I can understand the frustration but we will need to wait for the parcel to be sent back and reach our warehouse.I then asked, where they for real as they were unsure why I was saying what I was saying.Nike Athlete: Yes I am real.I then said I wished to raise a complaint. Nike Athlete: I can take your complaint here. Nike.com take complaints as feedback and all complaints are dealt with internally. You will not hear back from this.At this point I realised that Nike are not interested in my complaint. They are not interested in their customers. It's apparent that they are only interested in profit.My purchase was with Nike not dpd, and the fact that Nike allows you to register a complaint that goes unanswered speaks volumes. It is basically them telling you, ""you are small and unimportant and we don't give a #### BECAUSE YOU ARE SMALL AND UNIMPORTANT!!"".I am horrified that in this day and age companies like Nike are allowed to get away with such treatment.This really IS the last time I buy a Nike product.

Now I've got to send it back and hope I get refunded as when a man's hoodie turns up to the refund department I'm sure they are going think its supposed to be womens grey joggers and not refund me.

Dpd delivered an opened package of used trainers,AMum,1,"Dpd delivered my Nike trainers holding the box closed, however it had been torn open and the trainers inside were worn. I tried to complain to dpd who said it was for Nike to deal with. Nike said unless the trainers are badly damaged I can only have a discount code for buying more goods with them in future! When you pay full price directly with Nike you expect new trainers. It looked like I’d bought them used off eBay. Nike Customer services don’t care.I can also add, when I tried to speak to a supervisor as the customer services person said they couldn’t help, they said that service isn’t available and they wouldn’t give me their name or any number to distinguish themselves from other staff. Rubbish customer services, poor delivery service and not what you would expect from Nike at all",2023-12-09T12:15:03.000Z,Nike
I love the brand but not the customer…,Lauren,1,"I love the brand but not the customer service. In 2021 I made a custom order and they were never delivered. They said there was an issue and promised to send them to me again. It never happened and it took over 6 months to be resolved and get a refund. I was not refunded until 2022. On their system it stated the shoes had been returned for over 6 months but they still had possession of my money lol…. Nothing was refunded to my card until I remembered and contacted them. I asked to speak to a manager and the person on the phone kept trying to bribe me saying they will give me a discount code instead. I was adamant that I wanted to speak to a manager because I desperately wanted my custom Nike Dunks, not a refund and discount code.. but they were practically begging me and not giving in to my request for a manager. It was the most unprofessional and confusing customer service experience ever. He was obviously working from home and had no training. Eventually I got tired and accepted the offer of a discount code or credit. He said he would send it to my email and never did. I received nothing. I did not want to go through that again so never called again as I literally felt harassed and bribed. Have been purchasing a lot from Nike lately and every time I do I remember this instance and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",2023-12-09T04:15:18.000Z,Nike

Worst Shopping Experience in Years,Fan,1,"This is my first time shopping with Nike online because I got a gift card from a friend (otherwise I would never have shopped with them) and it's been such an awful experience through and through. I first placed an order during Black Friday for the discount, and that was 2 weeks ago. After 12 days I still didn't get my order and on the carrier's page (DHL) it shows that the tracking number doesn't even exist. I asked the Nike customer service about the order status and got the reply that my parcel is probably lost in transit and they're willing to give me a new gift card, but they didn't mention the Black Friday discount though, and the new gift card simply doesn't work because I keep getting error message. I was told to try in Incognito tab and their app but none worked. Apparently I'm not alone here. I'll keep asking Nike till I get a satisfactory answer. Needless to say, I will never ever shop with Nike again.",2023-12-07T14:01:07.000Z,Nike

AVOID NIKE,Mathias Würtz Kolster,1,"Et par af mine Jordans er gået i stykker inden for garantiperioden, og derfor kontakter jeg Nike for at få en form for kompensation. De giver mig to muligheder. Enten skal jeg sende dem retur, hvorved jeg vil blive kompenseret, og ellers skal jeg tage ind i en Nike-butik med dem. De kan også give en 20% rabatkode – fedt når de kører 25% grundet Black Friday. Derfor kører jeg til Aarhus, hvor jeg får at vide, at de ikke kan behandle ordrer fra Webshoppen, fordi de ikke er en partner-butik men blot en form for Reseller. Det virker ekstremt ulogisk taget deres ALT, der resterer af information omkring denne butik i betragtning. Den eneste information, der bliver givet, er, at det er en (partnered)-butik på Nikes hjemmeside. Det er ikke noget, de gør meget ud af at fortælle om. De kunne i hvert fald ikke gøre noget. Derfor ringede jeg igen til Nike, som kun kunne give mig én mulighed – at indsende skoene. Det stoler jeg simpelthen ikke på. De er alt for værdifulde for mig til, at jeg bare vil sende dem ind og eventuelt få nogle penge tilbage. Jeg synes, at det er ekstremt ringe, at der ikke stilles andre løsninger i udsigt. Vi er godt vante i Danmark, hvor andre forhandlere kompenserer, men åbenbart ikke Nike.A couple of my Jordans have broken within the warranty period, so I contact Nike to get some kind of compensation. They give me two options. Either I can send them back, in which case I will be compensated, or I can take them to a Nike store. They can also give a 20% discount code - great when they're running 25% off due to Black Friday. So I drive to Aarhus, where I'm told that they can't process orders from the webshop because they are a partner store but not an official reseller. This seems extremely illogical considering ALL that remains of information about this store. The only information given is that it is a (partnered) store on Nike's website. It's not something they make a big deal about. They certainly couldn't do anything about it. So I called Nike again and they could only give me one option - to return the shoes. I simply don't trust that. They are far too valuable to me to just send them in and ‘possibly’ get a refund. I think it is extremely poor that no other solutions are offered. We are used to other retailers in Denmark compensating, but apparently not Nike.",2023-12-06T17:43:54.000Z,Nike

"I QUIT AFTER THIS SHOCKING DISCOVERY - They screwed up an entire product range (manufactured holes) but still distributed it and hid the faults, just to squeeze out any profits from unaware customers!",Nike ambassador for thirty yrs,1,"I usually don't care about product delays, discounts, etc. Nike was always just like any other, but today changes that. Never in my life have I heard of a famous brand deliberately try to con customers in a sly way just to squeeze some extra profit. Long story short, they manufactured a product range called Nike Club+ Winterized Fleece and screwed up. There are huge holes (missing fleece panels) behind the paper thin reinforced nylon panels. This is like having sections of your clothes replaced with just paper so it feels strange, cold and windy. We know Nike screwed up their manufacturing process because their design was copied from a popular outdoor design from other famous brands like The North Face, so you can easily see what Nike's product range was supposed to be. They never published the product range on their portfolio but they continued to distribute the faulty products anyway to numerous outlets with instructions to insert a huge RRP price tag alongside a huge discount, making customers seem like they are getting a deal. The product descriptions, unsurprisingly, are full of misleading marketing jargon. Those outlets selling the faulty product coincidentally never have free shipping or free return shipping, meaning there's a large chance the customer will not bother returning the product, so the customers will eventually pay for Nike's error. I've heard many stories of Nike's greed culture for decades, and secretly hiring kids to make their shoes while exaggerating and even at times, outright making stuff up, about how green and great and socially responsible they are, which I honestly didn't care too much about, but this new discovery really shows how evil Nike actually is. Rather than ignore this issue after a few huffs and puffs like the average person, I am publicly documenting it. I am ashamed to have supported Nike for so long - God knows how many other customers were silently victimized and how many other products they screwed up in. This review will probably not get many eyes but rest assured I will echo this new discovery in many groups to protect us, the customers. If you are reading this, help us echo too.",2023-12-05T14:00:57.000Z,Nike

Delivery issues,Omojo Shaibu,1,I ordered two pairs of trainers to be given as presents on the 22nd of November and till now they haven't been delivered. I called the delivery company (Dpd) and was told it's being held at thier Hinkley depo and need to contact the sender to get intouch with them to sort the issue out. I called Nike I explained to them what Dpd had said and Nike said it'll take ten working days to get intouch with Dpd so the investigation can begin. I mean 10 WORKING DAY!!. By then the birthday would be past. I really don't understand how it will take two weeks to get intouch with the delivery company they always use to deliver thier customers orders. I'm totally unhappy. They need to get better ways of resolving issues like this.,2023-11-28T10:45:44.000Z,Nike

At the end it got sorted but not with ease. Just now I had ordered a pair of shoes on which I got a Black Friday and member discount. They had given me the wrong tracing number, once I called they ended up cancelling my ordered and started my refund. I called back because the woman had said I could reorder it again but the app wouldn’t let me. So I wanted to see if anything could be done, I sat through the over the phone questions twice and both times got hung up on.

"Should be 0 stars, ongoing issue since March!",Oliver McQuillin,1,"Should be 0 stars, absolutely diabolical Nike customer service. When trying to purchase on Nike.Com - I receive notification that ""payment is not accepted"" - my employee discount is applied, however when purchasing it doesn't allow me to fulfil the order. (former employee btw) This issue has been ongoing since the 1st March 2023.I have spoken with all departments including HR, IT, Customer Service and my own line manager and no department and no individual has been able to rectify this issue. I asked on far too many occasions to reset my log on details and have been provided with the explanation that my purchasing history will be removed. This is ridiculous response to a customer and former internal colleague. The whole operation is utterly pathetic. As a long-time supporter of Nike and a frequent customer, this experience has left me feeling disheartened and undervalued as a customer. I believe that a brand like Nike, known for its quality products, should also excel in providing exceptional customer service.I sincerely hope that improvements can be made within your customer service department to ensure that customers like me receive the support and assistance they deserve when facing issues with Nike products. Your attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.",2023-11-25T13:20:42.000Z,Nike

Unfortunately, within just one month of use, the shoes developed significant wear and tear issues, including a noticeable tear. I promptly reached out to both Nike and Myntra to address the problem. However, the response from both ends was disappointing. Despite my efforts, there was no resolution, neither in terms of a replacement nor a refund.The lack of durability in a product at this price point is concerning, and the unhelpful customer service only added to the frustration. As a loyal customer, I expected better from Nike and Myntra.I would caution others to think twice before investing in Nike products through Myntra, considering the subpar quality and the unsatisfactory customer support.

Appalling customer service!!,Missbabs ,1,"I have just spent an hour and 20 minutes, trying to resolve an issue with this joke of a company! Yesterday we attempted to place an order, using the start 23 promo code and a gift voucher adding both gift card  number and pin. All the details were placed correctly including shipping and billing etc. On placing the order, an error code came up so the order wouldn’t process. I rang the company this morning to report this  only to be told that I would get a phone call straight back. Needless to say I did not receive that call. I have just spent an hour and 15 minutes on chat with them, trying to resolve it for them. We have been given every single excuse under the Sun as to why the order won’t go through. We have furnished them with every single piece of information they have requested including the screenshots of the order. We have checked the billing. We have checked the shipment details along with everything else three times over, We have also emailed them the details and tried emptying the basket and re-ordering on different devices as they have requested none of this works as I informed them. It is quite obvious to me that along with our account details they have this order on screen but are still requesting proof which we have provided twice and they are still maintaining that they cannot resolve this which is quite obviously complete rubbish. At this point I asked for this to be further escalated and requested to be put through to a complaints department. At this point, the chat was ended without my consent! What an absolute joke of a company!! Please be aware folks that if you are purchasing gift cards with this company, you will be unable to redeem them and they will certainly not assist you in this matter. This was a simple issue that should have been resolved in 5 mins and yet they are refusing to assist any further. This is quite easily the worst experience I have ever had with any retailer. They quite obviously do not honour gift cards so be wise and shop elsewhere. I am a long-standing customer of Nike but never again will I spend a penny with this awful company.

I am writing to express my…,R M,1,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent order I made from Nike. I received a pair of shoes, but unfortunately, they were the wrong ones inside the correct box. To rectify this error, I traveled from Epsom to Westfield (Shepherd's Bush) hoping to exchange them for the right pair. Upon reaching the store, they informed me that although they had the correct shoes, they couldn't facilitate the exchange.Subsequently, I contacted Nike's customer service to inquire about the possibility of exchanging the shoes in-store. However, I was advised to return the incorrect shoes via the post office to receive a refund and then purchase the correct pair separately. This was incredibly frustrating, as the mistake wasn't mine, yet I was being inconvenienced by having to go to the post office.Following another call to Nike, a different representative assured me that if the store could exchange the shoes, I could do it there. Returning to the Nike store, I explained the situation once more. However, despite confirming that the wrong shoes were cheaper than the ones I ordered and acknowledging the mix-up, they declined the exchange as the prices did not match.I am extremely upset about this entire ordeal. It's frustrating to endure unnecessary inconvenience due to someone's lack of attention to detail, resulting in the wrong items being sent. I regret to say that this experience has seriously undermined my trust in Nike's online ordering system.

They accepted and issued the refund. The lady send me gift card and PIN number to my email. After a week I decided to use it and the card was empty. I contacted them straight away and been told that the card has been used they even told me the name and when was used. I never gave the gift card to anyone I didn’t even know how to check the balance. They told me I might gave  to someone when but I did not. They not suppose to allow other ppl to use it when they issue for a specific customer. I reported to action fraud and when I texted them that I reported they never replied back.

Also lost 10£ on top cash back app as they had to refund it and needed to purchase again.

So I reached out to customer service again and they said they do not have any information about the shipment either. To me that's ridiculous. I was told to wait until the end of day and if my package does not arrive then to reach back out to them. I said if the package had been shipped wouldn't they know it? I pointed out that they are not just sending packages out without knowing where they are going. Then the customer service agent said again to wait until the end of day and reach back out.",2023-11-10T16:52:57.000Z,Nike

Absolute shambles,Alastair,1,For the past three weeks I have been trying to get a pair of trainers delivered for my nephews birthday.the first order never turned up and they claimed the courier vou still find my address which has never happened before with and delivery.Also they know the courier guy who delivers locally for Nike and he told me had never had a thing for me in the past 3 weeks.After an exhausting chat with what I suspect was a robot with random emojis that didn’t make any sense and lots of pre loaded insincere apologies and rubbish about how important I am to them the chat was interrupted and somebody else took over who may have been real .who knows?! .they sorted it apparently so a new order was created and meant to be despatched with urgency.Nine days later and it is still waiting to be shipped.I have had three conversations with their AI  chatbot very similar to the above all eventually interrupted by somebody else and never with any resolution or explanation we are no further forward.They don’t seem to care at all and I have never once been contacted by email or phone as requested to resolve the issue.Bonkers that a billon dollar card company can not even spend some money to actually have customer service ls you can talk to and resolve issues l.Then maybe their customer might believe that they are part of the ‘Nike Family ‘ that they so relentlessly bang on about in their app and every bit of marketing they produce.Never again will a buy from this arrogant company who are incapable of even delivering the products they advertise.,2023-11-02T22:49:17.000Z,Nike

It was a headache and a hassle to do since they could easily have a place on their website to register for a return which would be more convenient for customers in general.

Tried again Friday, because they were the only ones who had the style of sports bra I wanted. Just now got an email, that actually the items were sold out and thus my order cancelled. Best bit?

Unresolved Refund Issue,Kamil oraczko,1,"Unresolved Refund Issue - Extremely Disappointed CustomerI am deeply disappointed with my recent experience with Nike's customer service and returns process. I returned a pair of shoes in early September, and despite receiving confirmation that a refund was processed on the 10th of September, the funds have yet to be credited back to my account.This situation is completely unacceptable. Nike has their goods, but I am left without my money. I have waited patiently, but my refund has not materialized. What adds to the frustration is the contradictory information I have received from Nike's customer service agents. The lack of clarity and consistency in their responses has only added to my frustration and confusion.I strongly urge anyone considering a purchase from Nike to think twice. Their customer service is appalling, and their returns process is incredibly flawed. It's disheartening to see a company of Nike's reputation mishandle a simple refund transaction. As a customer, I expect reliability and transparency, both of which were sorely lacking in this experience.This incident has shattered my trust in Nike as a brand. I hope this review serves as a warning to potential buyers. Nike took my money and the shoes back, but they failed to deliver on their end of the transaction. I will think long and hard before considering another purchase from Nike in the future.",2023-10-27T17:38:51.000Z,Nike

Nike Oxford street is a Scam!! Scam!!!,Alex Der,1,"I am absolutely seething with rage over the abhorrent treatment I've received from Nike at their Oxford Street, London store. Just a couple of months ago, I made the unfortunate decision to buy a pair of shoes from them, and lo and behold, they turned out to be riddled with manufacturing faults. Nike's own policy, which they claim to uphold, states that they offer a two-year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. But let me tell you, the reality has been nothing short of a nightmare. Despite bombarding them with countless emails detailing my grievances, they have chosen to not just disregard me but utterly disrespect their own policy. It's a scam, plain and simple! Nike London has zero regard for their own commitments and responsibilities.I am beyond furious, and I vehemently warn anyone even contemplating a purchase from Nike in London to think long and hard.

I spent a whopping 4 HOURS on calls over an 8-week period trying to sort this mess, only to have them randomly send a gift card to my home after they explicitly told me they couldn't. And the icing on the cake? When I finally spoke to an agent about compensation for all the trouble they've put me through, I was told there was nothing they could do. Nike, this is NOT how you treat loyal customers. Fix your customer service processes and train your representatives better.",2023-10-18T16:05:50.000Z,Nike
I made a purchase of some shoes,customer,1,"I made a purchase of some shoes , and they sent me wrong size. Contacting customer support via chat was quite upsetting. I am disabled and housebound, these were supposed to be a present , the person the other end was disinterested and quite aggressively hurrying me up, whilst I was typing I was asked if I had finished with chat even though the issue wasnt resolved. I explained to him that I don't have printer that if I was to be sent a code to exchange,  could it please go to the person who will have to take them back, they took the email address and still they sent it to me. This was all their fault, it seems Nike needs to give their staff training, because at the moment it is sub par. I will never shop with them againThe shoes were Nike court vision low size 9 ( they sent size 10) which 9 doesn't even resemble 10 , such a basic error",2023-10-18T15:37:26.000Z,Nike

The colleague present grabbed the store manager, another rude member of staff, called Jason who refused to share with us his staff name who had been rude to us and told us to contact customer service for a return, as in his opinion, the issue was 'wear & tear' and refused to acknowledge the issue with the air pump of the airmax trainers (which belong to my 10 years old boy). We were not planning to let such people to ruin our Sunday so we walked away and will try to contact customer services tomorrow.

Due to the fault the caused me to fall down the stairs.I contacted Nike and they then sent an email with a barrage of questions and asking for digital photos of the trainers.Once I had taken photos of where the accident happened, and filledOut the rest of the questions location indoors or outdoors, weather conditions etc etc sent it away with the order number. And wasPromised by Jeffrey he would get every thing done. Waited a few weeks and nothing. Chased them again and nothing. Spoke to Ritik in May and she asked me to send the trainers back to the Netherlands. And she also said I would be getting compensation as well as a refund for the trainers. The. It all went quiet again. It wasn’t until after chatting to Nike assist on chat numerous times, soMany I lost count. Emmanuel looked into it. He said they hadn’t got the trainers back to which I confirmed back to him they were sent at the beginning of June and I got the refund on the 13th June. 7 days later I got an email with a gift card for £114. Within the letter Nike assist trained to makeOut the refund of £114 was part of a good will gesture. Totally incorrect. Nike members can return faulty trainers for up to 2 years. This infuriated me.From September onwards it was going around and around with Nike assist. I was then offered £300 fromA so called senior manager from either china or the Philippines. He promised it would be with me within the next 24 hours. It never turned up. I was the informed Nike Nike assist it would be with me no later than the following Tuesday. It didn’t turn up. By this time and 7 months in I was starting toLoose my patience. A senior manager who confined they called from the Philippines with this case apologised and said they would increase the gift card and confirmed it in an email through Nike assist which I received on the 27th September 2023.We can now advise you that we would like to offer an additional goodwill gesture of £185.05. The GC total was £300 also a 25% promo code Now as you can clearly see this states £185.05 on top of the original £300 gift card.Nike assist in either china or the Philippines are now back tracking and trying to make out the £185.05 is not additional it is in the £300 gift card. Since then I have three so called senior managers all call me back in the last week which has failed miserably. Due to the fact that the line is absolutely terrible as well as I could hardly understand what they was saying due to the poor line. To add insult to injury you could hear another person telling the so called manager on the phone what to say. The most insulting part is when each and every one of them has asked me to hold for twoMinutes and then hang up on me.How in gods nameIs this customer service. Then when I have asked for an email for the UK head office toLodge a formal complaint about the senior team dealing with this case I am toldI cannot have an email because that’s not how Nike works Exactly happens the same when you try and call and ask for the I for the information. How is it good practice for a customer / stakeholder of Nike who wants to lodge a formal complaint is refused the email or telephone number to lodge the complaint. They are told that feedback will be given to the senior team who the customer wants to complain about. How the hell is that logical. I hope Sarah Hannah and John Donohue are so very happy with the way Nike is being so dramatically let down by the Nike assist teams in the Philippines and china. Formover 25 years I have worked in client/customer service and NEVER in my life have I been treated so horribly and ignored by a company. This is Nike for gods sake. What the hell is going on.I am still recovering from the hematoma in my lower right leg. Nikes senior management just simply don’t want to know or care.I have simply lost count of the amount of people who have lied and broken promises again and again and again.Nike assist you should be absolutely ashamed of your disgraceful service.

I explained I can get my wife to call me and show the receipt and trainers via video call. I also showed my  phone to the manager as I paid with Apple Pay. The manager refused to refund the difference making every excuse possible. He suggest I come back with the receipt and trainers, by which point I’d be paying more in fuel. Very unhappy.

I contacted Nike & spoke to many agents & sent a picture of my proof of postage but they say theOnly reason could be  I only sent one pair because the weight shown on the proof of postage wasn’t heavy enough for 2 pairs of trainers.

Absolute  joke of a company & terrible customer service for such a big company! To be accused by a so called manager I got to speak to of only sending 1 pair back when I’ve done everything correctly is shocking & rude!

How terrible are Nike,Wayne,1,"How terrible are Nike, customer service none existent, no complaints process and the information (proof of purchase) they ask for when purchased from one of their retail partners is shocking. Paid off trainers and faulty, emailed Nike and asked for three things proof of purchase, picture of the faulty trainer and then a picture inside of the label. Great well I thought it was great, JD emailed me the receipt on one of their satellite tills when busy and I paid by card so as long as I got a email with the receipt then great. Nike was wasn’t happy with this and wanted a hard copy (picture) or a pdf version but they don’t attach it as a PDF it’s on the body of the email so Nike won’t accept.Even took screen shots on my phone (one do the mailbox showing the email painted and a screen shot of the email body containing the full receipt)Managed to get a PDF copy of the receipt only then to be asked for a bank statement (this was not on original request) Two times in my life I have contacted Nike with faulty products, the first time I give up half way through because odd how difficult it is, Thai time a little more persistent but what a terrible process they have and I think they need to bring the policy in line with the money seen tech world we are on today!!There again you can see by all these reviews how customer focused they are, i only scrolled through a few reviews in here but I can see there has been no response from Nike.

If I could give negative points I…,Jasmine,1,"If I could give negative points I would. I would avoid ordering from Nike online, especially in Canada. I ordered a pair of shoes for my son for the new school year. The online ordering kept glitching and booting me out. I ultimately got charged twice for two pairs of shoes. Fine, stuff happens. Noticed the next day and called right away. Was told that I could only cancel within 30 minutes of ordering. I now had to wait for the shoes to be shipped to me and then re-send them back to Nike and once they received them then they could issue a refund. Order was placed and charged on Sept 2. Accidentally called the US number unknowingly and found out I could actually return to any store for a faster refund only to find out several minutes later that I couldn’t do that in Canada when he found out where I was located. This was after FedEx showed that the shoes were coming from Frankfurt in Germany and would take awhile to get here. At this point the issue was escalated and I was told supervisors would review and get back. By September 8th the package was stopped and held at a FedEx facility an hour away from me and got notice on the 11th that it was ready for pick up. I was extremely confused so called FedEx asking why the shoes would be shipped to such a far away facility (I assumed these were the pair I wanted). Call Fedex, they tell me the pkg has been stopped there by Nike and to call them to see what was going on. Call Nike. Nike rep says my one wanted pair is still on way, the pair at FedEx was being returned to Nike and once they have confirmation that Fedex has the unwanted shoes that I will get a refund. I did receive the wanted pair yesterday, which is nice I guess. So today, the 12th, I check the Shop app to see where the unwanted shoes now were and all info disappeared. Call Nike to see what was going on. Rep I spoke with said she would escalate for me.I said it already was escalated and I hadn’t heard back. Then she asked me to screenshot my debit account to prove I was double charged and then email them proof. I said why? I was given two sets of order and tracking numbers and wouldn’t have had the second pair shipped to me in the first place if not paid for in the first place. At this point, after all other requests to speak to a supervisor were denied in the past (except to have situation escalated and being assured I would get an email back from one, which I haven’t to date), I was put on hold and transferred to a supposedly real “supervisor.” Said supervisor then informed me that shoes were on the way back to a Nike facility and once received and processed then a refund could be issued finally. I asked how I was supposed to know where the shoes actually were and when they arrived as anyone could steal them at this point and I wouldn’t know. A tracking number was provided to me after I asked for it basically and wasn’t offered initially at all. Pretty shady to me. Then I asked if it had to ship all the way back to Frankfurt (I had originally asked if they could stop the order in Frankfurt Sept 3rd so that I could get a refund quicker also and was given all sorts of excuses as to why that wasn’t possible btw). At this point he says no, our Nike facility just needs to receive it first. I ask which facility it has to reach. Finally tells me Mississauga Ontario, the other side of the country. Also, once they process and recognize that their facility has actually received the shoes, and whenever they get around to processing the refund, it could take up to 10 additional business days to actually see any money in my account. I will be lucky to see my money back in a month after purchase date, I might add. And all while never laying hands on the unwanted product. I have been given the run around and told a lot of conflicting information and with zero recourse. I am a single parent who lives in one of the most expensive provinces and didn’t budget for an additional $130 at back to school time. It’s absolutely terrible that staff are so misinformed and generally unhelpful and that they treat people like this. Furthermore, there is apparently nothing you can do about it. I will never order from this company again. Their call centres are clearly outsourced to other countries too and no one cares.Just called FedEx after trying to track pkg online and realizing I was given the old tracking number. Recorded info says it was shipped back to sender and delivered to shipping and receiving today, Sept 12 at 5:46pm, and was told pkg was delivered today to facility in Mississauga at 10:46am and signed for by J. Jesse. They may take up to 4 days to report to Nike and however long for Nike to issue refund, then another 10 days for money to get to account. Business days obviously so looking at another 2 weeks at this point, for a total of 1 month for a refund.",2023-09-13T02:27:42.000Z,Nike
Horrible customer service,James,1,"Horrible customer service.  Due to health issues, I have been in the hospital for the better part of the past four years... my aorta dissected, now have a pig valve, pig root, prosthetic aorta over the hemi and then got sarcoidosis from the COVID 19 vaccine, my body does not produce the proper amount of red or white blood cells.   Right before my aorta dissected (was playing tennis at the time...) I had bought five pair of Nike Zoom Cage 3 tennis shoes, fits my foot perfect and knew eventually that you would stop manufacturing this shoe.  During my health struggles, I was fighting for my life, no running or tennis or physical activity restricted to lifting 40 pounds.   Now, after over four years, I have been given the go ahead to start playing tennis again... ""gentile"" tennis.  So, I got out one of my new Cage 3 pairs and broke then in with a walk, then playing tennis.  I noticed that there was something sharp on the outer edge of the left shoe irritating my foot so felt around inside the shoe and found what felt like a nail sticking into my foot.   I attempted to adjust it before playing tennis but no luck.  The object rubbing my foot actually hurt my foot to the extent that after three or four weeks it is still sore.  Knowing that these are new shoes, worn twice, I contacted Nike only to find out that they are ""out of warranty"" due to the fact that the time had been greater than six months.  Under normal circumstances, I do understand this policy but considering I am a loyal Nike customer and I spend the better part of the last four years in the hospital while tying to get better so I could one day maybe play tennis or even jog a quarter of a mile (used to run over 100 miles a week wearing Nike products...)  I was hoping Nike would  consider my situation a special case and perhaps I would qualify for a special exemption.  The two ""customer service"" managers would not even consider any compensation or replacement and were less than professional expressing this stance.  Needless to say, I will be moving on from Nike and find a more compassionate company to do business with in the future.  I will move my business elsewhere.

The next notification was to say my order is on the way back to Nike. I first contacted Nike on the online chat and all the person wanted to do was refund me. I made it clear that I did not want a refund and that I wanted my order to go back out for delivery once they had received it. I then phoned up which wasn't any better and the person said they would investigate. 10 minutes later after coming off the phone was an email processing a refund. A refund that I did not want.

Disappointed,Paul Bowman,1,"So disappointing.Supposed to be the ""official"" Nike website.Ordered 16 Aug still not received 4 Sept told they can't fulfill order and asked if I can wait till 12 Sept.I told them to cancel let's see if they refund me.Shocking - I will never use the ""official"" site and app again - they don't know what customer service is.",2023-09-04T22:53:17.000Z,Nike
Damaged goods twice,Han,1,Ordered trainers for a gift they arrived damaged shouldn’t have passed the quality check. Nike was quick to arrange a return for an exchange. The exchanged pair arrived several days later. This second pair that I received was in worse condition to the first pair. Definitely been worn with tears in the leather. Dirt marks where the heel sits. Sticker marks left and tape sewn in the stitching. No apology for it happening twice just a returns label emailed for a refund. Disgusting to receive from the direct seller being Nike not once but twice.,2023-09-04T22:47:16.000Z,Nike
Shambles won't ever buy from again,Gareth,1,"What can I say absolute shambles of a company to deal with. Tried multiple times to purchase running clothes online and every time didn't work. contacted an 'athlete' and was told to leave the account for 24 hours still no joy and customer support was closed. Waited another 24 hours and tried again, guess what still didn't work. Contacted customer support yet again and was told to leave the account for 24 hours. By this point I had given up hope and thought worth trying to speak to someone as one last attempt rather than a chat function how wrong I was. The automated function is the single worst thing I have ever come into contact with and talking to a wall would be less frustrating. Now after 3 days trying to part with my hard earned cash I can safely say after that experience I will never ever buy Nike again!",2023-09-04T20:52:24.000Z,Nike

For the second time Nike have lied about products being available and aren’t,Suzann Sime,1,"For the second time, I ordered from the sale, Nike said it had already delivered one part, as 25% off to purchase 2, so I got the socks I didn’t want separate and delivered asap and then the jacket was seen as ‘delivered’ a lie, and then ‘delayed’ after I called and complained. Again Nike as for the shoes I ordered came both times as Male, despite specifying it needed to be Female sizing as ordered and was assured it would be, 2 male sized delivered trainers later I was forced as already 3 weeks lost and only 30 days to ask for a refund, to request a refund. Again, Nike is buying time to force me into asking for a refund, falsely sending an email saying one of the items was dispatched on the actual day I ordered!!! Be warned, this is what Nike wants, they charge as many people as they can on discounted products, hold the money, but have only a few to distribute and when customers are forced to ask for a refund Nike is off the hook for FALSE Advertising that they have products but don’t. Do not buy any sale from Nike as it will not come, FAIR TRADING U.K. despite a Netherlands based company should stop this. Nike should no longer be able to trade retail or online anywhere in the U.K. my email details on my Nike account has been deleted by Nike! I took a screenshot so I will share this if anyone wants evidence that NIKE said it was delivered on the day ordered but liars! And U.K. registered but no complaints procedures, only put into feedback, no one you can contact how can the U.K. fair trading office know this is going on and allow it?! 15 days later, I received another email from NIKE saying that the item no longer is available, no surprise there with FALSE ADVERTISING their products and still NO MONEY REFUND, this is a new way NIKE is operating, take your money, keep it, make interest on it probably and then don't deliver the goods.",2023-09-03T22:47:05.000Z,Nike

I was refunded back to the gift card, but still am getting the same error messages, but this time when I called they couldn't place the order for me either. I mean this is absolutely rediculous how are you as a company going to want people to sign up to be Nike members and we can't even place any orders. I swear if the shoes I want are out of stock when this issue finally gets fixed I will delete my account, sell my gift cards and never buy another Nike product again. I've been buying Nike products for well over 30 years now but having thus many problems that not even the team members can do anything to help is crazy. You would think they would have this fixed because apparently this same issue has been happening alot for over a year now and still not fixed...

Absolutely awful online experience and customer service,Tara,1,"I accidentally ordered two pairs of the same trainers for my child on the Nike website on 11 August, but one was the correct size and one was a smaller size. I called immediately to cancel the wrong order and the customer service advisor cancelled the trainers that I wanted. When I told her what she'd just done, the line went dead - she'd hung up on me, presumably because she knew she'd made an error! And when I called back it was too late to cancel the other order. I was sent a form to give feedback, but I've had no apology about this incident.I then tried to rectify the matter by ordering the trainers again on 17 August. The payment went through (it says 'Nike' on the payment on my bank statement, so definitely not a scam site), but no confirmation order email was sent. I called Nike two days later -  the customer advisor asked for my order number. I didn't have it, as I hadn't received the confirmation order. He used my email address (the only one I have, so I couldn't have used an alternative) to track the order - no trace of it. The advisor suggested the payment is probably only pending (it wasn't) and to use the Nike app instead, ""as this kind of thing can happen on the website but not the app"", according to the advisor. So I've paid almost £60 and have no way of getting those trainers or the refund through Nike. Worse still, I've had to order the flipping trainers again! Thankfully, they are here and my child likes them - and I've returned the order that the advisor should have cancelled. Now I'm just waiting to get my money back on the order that Nike customer service can't trace. I have sent a complaint email to Nike about this, but I haven't heard anything back, so I called Nike again today (25 August) - just in case the first advisor was a total idiot, but the second advisor couldn't trace the order either. I told her that I hadn't heard back from my complaint email and she said that's because the only way you can complain is through providing ""feedback"", which she can then pass on to a supervisor. I did this, I expect to hear nothing as Nike is clearly a rubbish company in terms of customer service.It really is outrageously disgusting - how can you take someone's money, not provide the product and not be able to trace the order? I've had to go through my bank to get the money back. Obviously I will get it back, but it's a hassle and so unnecessary. This is why I hate online shopping!!!You have been warned!",2023-08-25T16:00:58.000Z,Nike

The quality of the rubber, webbing and material is low grade. The black splatter trainers had a chunk out of the back of the rubber outsole.

After ordering the next day I got a message that the trousers were dispatched with Bpost, but Bpost never received the package. So far no problem, Packages can be lost. But Nike decided to cancel the order instead of dispatching again and they told me to order the trousers again. In the meanwhile these golf trousers were no longer in discount and are now 33% more expensive and all Nike would offer me was a 10% discount. Completely disgraceful. Never again. I'll order my golf gear from other webstores from now on.",2023-08-11T10:30:20.000Z,Nike

Nike 24 Month Manufacture Warranty,Ste White,1,"I took advantage if Nikes exchange or refund policy for wear and tear within two years of the manufacture date and sent two sets of trainers back however on the initial online chat the advisor did not check whether these items were purchased directly from Nike.com one was and one was via JD Sports, because this was bot checked she sent me two returns labels one for the correct pair of Nike Mens UK 8.5 Waffle Ones (Multicoloured) this was received processed and refunded correctly, the second pair purchased via JD were Nike Mens UK 8.5 Waffle Ones (Beige) this was clearly stipulated in the chat however the advisor simply sent a returns label for a recently purchased pair of Nike Mens UK 8.5 Waffle Debut (Cream / Off White) and did not check where they were purchased from, this was in May i have been lied to, had chats ended on me, had calls cut off on me have been given several false promises each different each time, i am consistently asked to repeat myself although all notes and evidence are on files i’ve sent the royal mail receipt, the online receipt from JD and a VAT receipt from JD. However i am consistently asked to send this again. I started this process in early May (3 Months) 20+ chats 6 Phone calls and two times senior members of staff were supposed to contact me which they do in an initial email requesting all of the information they already have on file and when i iterate this to them that is the last i hear from them and they do not respond to any further emails and i have to start all over again.Its quite simple really give me a refund or give me an equivalent pair of trainers, it seems as though Nike must have a policy of rejecting applicants for jobs with IQ’s above 89.",2023-08-09T23:17:39.000Z,Nike
Thieves that do not care about their customers,Monika,1,"I returned two items back in early March. After countless web chats, phone calls and emails they refunded me for one of the items.

They have now told me about 15 times that the issue is escalated with their senior team and I should hear back in 3-4 days.. shock horror, I never hear anything back and I keep chasing them.

The fabric on my pair of Alphafly Nature running trainers split (on both shoes) causing a significant defect. Upon returning the trainers (which I had to provide every last bit of information on to prove I had in fact purchased them from a trusted site), all communications has dropped away. This was on the 6th June. It’s been over 2 months and I’ve still not received the refund I have been promised in emails. I have called up probably 7/8 times over the past 2 months and each time I’m promised the refund will be made very soon. For a brand as big as Nike, I’m appalled by the customer service and lack of information. Genuinely embarrassing. Do not buy Nike if you ever might need to return a faulty item.

What an earth has happened the Nike???? Use to be a great brand, which is sadly no longer the case!!!

Subject: Frustrating Experience with Nike Customer Support,El,1,"I wish to share my experience with Nike's customer service regarding the purchase and refund of a faulty pair of tennis shoes. The process proved to be frustratingly complicated, filled with inconsistencies and miscommunications from Nike's end.When I sought a refund for the faulty shoes, I was led to believe that I would receive a cash refund. Instead, the refund was credited back to a gift card I had used, due to a miscommunication by Nike. This initiated a time-consuming exchange to rectify this mistake.Different customer service representatives provided varying explanations, and it took significant effort on my part to achieve resolution. Nike finally agreed to refund me as I had initially understood, but labeled it a 'one-time exception', not acknowledging it as a correction of their error.When I sought additional compensation for the inconvenience, I was told the provided compensation was 'sufficient'. This felt dismissive given the time and energy I spent correcting Nike's mistake. This case dragged on &gt; 1 month.Nike's current Trustpilot score of 1.6 stars, with over 5000 reviews, echoes my dissatisfaction. For such a reputable brand, the level of customer service is disappointing. My advice to others would be to ensure all agreements with Nike are written and confirmed via email and be prepared for a potentially lengthy resolution process.Or, shop elsewhere if you can!",2023-07-29T14:00:43.000Z,Nike

"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!! Rip off company!!!!",Karen Conway,1,"Placed an order on the 12th July and was meant to be delivered on 19th July, now I live in Scotland and was going to Belfast for someone’s birthday hence the order in the first place anyways was getting it delivered to a store in Belfast so I could give it to the birthday person and paid part gift card and balance via debit card. After placing the order on 12th July I received an email confirmation for the order and just waiting on the dispatch email, day’s pass and on the 18th July called customer service complete joke and waste of time she just said it will arrive tomorrow, tomorrow arrives the 19th July still no email called that morning another advisor said yes it’s being delivered today so waited called on Thursday 20th July had to call twice just to explain that I’m leaving Belfast please cancel down order so I can get my gift card back to buy one in store she said yes she would do it and it would take 24 hours I said that’s fine as I will wait 24 hours goes to store and guess what nothing has been done so had to pay full amount again via my bank as no gift card back nothing refunded and obviously 🙄 I’m still wanting to give a present, anyways thought it may just be an oversight and called on Monday 24th July explained everything to the advisor and she said I’m going to speak with my manager see what we can do because it was meant to be cancelled down and I have had to pay for a 2nd tracksuit and it’s been nearly 2 weeks since I placed the order, so she comes back and said look because it’s our error completely and you have purchased a 2nd tracksuit etc we are going to suspend the gift card from the original order and refund your full money to your card ending **** so I clarified this with her 3 times to make sure that all the money was going to my bank account and she said yes definitely that was on Monday 24th July and she even said this may take up to 48 hours so I’m going to give you a call back on Wednesday 26th July to make sure everything has went as it should have, I’m thinking great at last and they are putting in my bank account so I have used the gift card in an around about way. Well yesterday being Tuesday 25th July here comes the email’s 1 for a gift card and 1 for the bank account and I’m like what is going on so called them and the customer service is the worst I have ever experienced 1st call waste of time and he was so rude I said I want to make a complaint as I want my money as promised not another gift card and he was basically like tough that’s how you paid for the first order and was trying to explain everything to him and he just said we have been on the phone for 17 minutes and we don’t have a complaint’s procedure and stated I’m disconnecting the call and hung up so had to call back again and this time she started with yes it’s all going into your bank account the full amount they just need a bit more time and I said but I have had an email for something about refund processed to a gift card and she was like oh hold the line she had me holding for 10 minutes and came back on the phone to say yes the advisor on Monday requested it to your bank but they haven’t done that and they have processed it now so it can’t be changed so said to her I want to speak with a manager she said that’s not possible then I said it states at the start of the call “all call’s are recorded” so I want mine listened too and a formal complaint made she said we don’t do that its just feedback we take, so honestly I’m cracking up by now and saying to her look I just want my money back and she like but you have it on the gift card and I’m stating but it’s not meant to be like that but honestly she didn’t care she also said to me we have been on the phone 38 minutes (this must be a thing Nike teach advisor’s) and I said to her that’s because you are not listening to me or helping me and have put me on hold for a long period of time several times and she said well I’m going to end the call because you have a gift card now. So it’s now been 48 hours and surprise NO the advisor from Monday hasn’t called me back and obviously 🙄 I still don’t have my money and by that I mean the money to my bank account as agreed because do Nike really think I’m going to order again after this!!! This company need’s to take a long hard look at how staff are dealing and treating the customer’s who are buying the item’s that keep them in the job, review the complaint’s procedure and finally stop ripping people off by not giving us the item’s we pay for and just keeping our money as a gift card is not the same!!!! So long story but worth paying attention to as you do NOT want to go through what I had too deal with.

Nike have no customer complaints department,Jill H,1,"I recently received an email from Nike for unlocking a £20 reward for being a Nike member. I ordered a Nike tracksuit for my nephew . Bearing in mind I only ordered because I had 20 off. I wouldn’t normally pay £64 for a small kids tracksuit. To cut a long story short Nike apparently don’t have a complaints department so I’m s@&t out of luck. £20 pound was a big deal as I said I never would have purchased the tracksuit. Customer services, if that’s what you want to call them, wouldn’t answer my questions and just keep stating we didn’t send you an email even when I uploaded a copy of the email. I’m fuming. Never again will I purchase from Nike. No help whatsoever. Rude as he kept saying the same thing and ignoring me. Basically not answering when asking to complain. Nike if that’s how you do business it’s shocking. Local businesses are way more helpful these days.",2023-07-20T16:05:20.000Z,Nike
On my latest purchase from Nike,Victoria Itiberê,1,"On my latest purchase from Nike, everything went wrong, from the delivery, customer service, opening hours.It started when my 6 y/o nephew asked for a France's jersey with Mbappe's name stamped for his 7th birthday.I searched everywhere without any luck, and finally after talking to Nike's custumer assistance, the person on the other side of the phone recommended me to buy a France blank shirt and print/stamp Mbappe's name on it, and he said that Nike town in London would do this for me.I purchased it on a Thursday and the delivery was supposed to arrive Saturday so I could collect in the evening and go to London Sunday and customise in time. The parcel didn't arrive until next Monday, and as I work from monday to Saturday I couldn't do what I planned because of the terrible service from nike/evri. I travelled on the next Sunday to London to arrive at the shop first thing in the morning, 10 AM is the opening hour advertised on Google. Arriving there, I discovered the store would just open at 12 so I had to wait for two hours and wasting a lot of my time in Oxford st when I was not planning for it (AGAIN).Finally when it opened they told me they could not do what I wanted, that they don't keep the font and numbers for all their kits and that the France ones they didn't have in store since December last year. Their recommendation in store was for me to buy it online but I told them that they don't offer for that size with customisation online because probably it was sold out. My nephew's birthday is in 13 days, and I have lost more than two weeks because of misleading information from Nike and also the money on train tickets for nothing just to end up with an expensive shirt that is not exactly how he wanted. I will return this purchase to Nike and will never be buying anything from them again",2023-07-19T17:10:32.000Z,Nike

Never expected such an experience from a brand like Nike, no complaints department in the UK, customer service copy pastes verbatim, no human element, utter crap.

Both boxes were damaged and one was missing the outer sleeve, subsequently I contacted the Nike experts and to be honest although polite, the representative continued to refer to the seniors.  The outcome was merely that the packaging isn't part of the pricing of the shoe so they were unable to do anything but return.  The issue I had was that I would of been left giftless for relatives birthday's and also the inconsistency and lack of empathy for the situation was very poor.  This is not what I have previous expected from Nike's level of customer service, so missing packaging and damaged packing is not recognised as an issue, something I have never experienced with other retailers.Very disappointed with Nike for the first time.",2023-07-10T16:58:08.000Z,Nike

Miserable customer service and unable to proceed order,Verena ,1,"I tried to make an online order at Nike.com. The order contained 6 pairs of shoes and over 580$ of value. I submitted the order and a day later I received an email from Nike saying that they had cancelled the order and I should contact customer service.  Customer service tells me that my billing information didn’t match and that the order was declined by they billing team. Solution: I had to do it all over again - no support from their end by just re-submitting the order. This is what every half established business does these days. Ok so I put in the time again, searched for all shoes again in the size, put them into my card and this time used PayPal as a payment method as they had told me that the order was declined bc of my credit card before. Doing this I realize that some of the items didn’t had the discount on it they had the day before. So I reached out to Nike customer service again and they said that they will apply it after I submit my order again. So I stayed on the line with customer service - again- for about 45 min. One day after this, I receive AGAIN an email from Nike saying that they had cancelled my order and that I should contact customer service. Guess what? Customer service recommends just submitting the order again. As a summary: spend 2,5h talking to Nikes customer service with zero help or outcome, 1200$ blocked on my credit card and no solution. Super unprofessional! Instead of training your customer service people on how to small talk and make compliments on the selections etc. You should first cover the most important - actually providing a valuable solution to your customer. And this can’t be telling them to do the same thing they already did, because that clearly failed. Learning: I am buying Adidas and New Balance sneakers from now on.",2023-07-07T19:18:42.000Z,Nike

I have just recieved my Nike by You…,pavel rodideal,2,"I have just recieved my Nike by You shoes, air force 1. I have another pair bought from the official Nike store in the town i live. And i can say this: the ones from the store are great. The Airforce 1 by You are garbage. Yes. Garbage. Leather does not even feel like real leather.( maybe because it isn't real leather) after 7 hours of wearring in the office :))))) they look much worse than the pair i have from the original store since 1 month and i weared them almost daily. I compared the leather on the Nike by You pair with some cheam shoes made in Romania that sell for less than 50 euro  and the romanian shoes leather is better than the one used on the Nike by You shoes. I don't know what to say and what to think about this. I allways tought Nike are the best. I had only great experiences with nike since forever until now. The conclusion is I payed more for a pair of shoes that are much less compared to the cheaper and much more durable that i have bought from the store. I have a pair of Nike i payed 50 euros in 2016 and still look good after n machine washes, they are still wearable. But Nike by You does not seem to last more than 2 months before they litteraly break apart so my conclusion stick with original nike shoes from official stores that you can check before buying",2023-06-30T20:26:41.000Z,Nike
Awful service is not worthy of the brand,Angela Clainos,1,"Husband and I each bought a pair of the same shoe. After wearing them for around a year, both shoes cracked in the frame at the back and the sharp edges digging into our heels made them impossible to wear. Nike supposedly has a 2 year claim policy for this sort of quality issue. Sent them both in for a refund claim and it has been the biggest nightmare I have ever had to deal with.The first pair of shoes were assessed and I received a gift card for the amount we paid. Tried to use the gift card, system said it has £0. Contacted Nike who say the gift card has been used (by whom???) and refuse to give me a name or any details about the order, even though that is considered theft. More than likely used by a Nike employee with access to this info.5 months later I am still contacting Nike about the second pair which I was informed today ""are in the warehouse being checked"". There is no one to escalate to. Every single one of the 10 agents I have spoken to over chat promise they will message their colleagues who are dealing with the case and they will get back to me. No such thing.Basically if you have a claim against your Nike shoes, don't put yourself through this pain. Just throw them out, agree to never go near the brand again and move on to Adidas or New Balance who have better looking shoes anyway. Michael Jordan made Nike famous, but he can't keep Nike famous forever, especially with this awful quality and shocking customer service.",2023-06-30T12:12:31.000Z,Nike

Shame on you Nike, first of all... this wouldn't have even happened if you all just sent the right shoes in the first place.

I would like to log a formal complaint…,Louise,1,I would like to log a formal complaint as I placed an order C01234398332 and I have not received the infant kit as it was not enclosed. I have waited almost 2 weeks for a resolution to this and I still have not received a refund. I was told an investigation was raised twice but that I would not receive a refund for the kit that was not packed with the other items.Due to the poor service I have received I have returned the rest of the order. But I am still waiting for this refund also. The service is really poor and I will not purchase directly from Nike again.,2023-06-19T18:15:57.000Z,Nike

Really disappointed to be writing this…,Annemarie Halpin,1,"Really disappointed to be writing this review as I’ve been a loyal customer for over 10yrs and never had a problem till this year. I have tried to order on two separate occasions trainers for both which are a couple of months apart to first email to say delayed and when I contacted the company to be told they are out of stock. Yet still could be purchased online? I spoke to customer service of which he was the rudest person who basically told me that he could do nothing about it. Bit of a joke really. For such a big company something as simple as stock checking between store and warehouse to be so bad. Really bad experience, been let down twice with the same issue.

Absolutely disgusting Company,Leanne Woodhams,1,"Absolutely disgusting Company. I ordered the wrong size clothes for my son at the end of May, so sent £133 worth back untouched and ordered them again in a bigger size. The return has been ""lost"" at the warehouse. The company have not had the decency to contact me to update me with where the parcel is and where my £133 is (I've called them 3 times and there is no option to email). Despite me having proof of return and and evidence that the parcel was received, no body is bothering to resolve the issue for me or keep me updated. It's now been 3 weeks and not a peep from them. I will be making a complaint to trading standards. Fortunately my bank are assisting me with this investigation and returning my money. Which is good because it is needed for my sons birthday. Will never be using Nike again. Such a disappointment. All other big brands are able to treat their customers with respect and not scam them, take their money and ignore them. DISPICABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. This brand is going down the pooper. Run while you still can.

Its been 6 weeks and after numerous dealings with the their useless customer service agents that act like NPC's and senior managers that promise call backs but never actually contact you, I've received no answer what so ever.The parcel is clearly lost/stolen and they are not willing to do anything about it, they even told me to get in touch with Evri to start a claim. How can the sender tell a customer to start a claim when it should be them? I've never experienced such stupidness from a company as huge as Nike.

Do not buy directly from Nike,Richard Dickinson,1,Placed original order with Nike on 5th May.  Unfortunately they choose to use EVRI as a delivery partner who returned the order to Nike after only 2 failed delivery attempts to a pick up locker.  At the point Nike refunded me straight away so I placed a subsequent order on 12th May having to change 1 product as now out of stock.  On 15th May got email saying issue with delivery and they would contact me when my order would be dispatched.  10 days later and no contact.  So I contact them.  After lots of contact with customer services managed to get them to cancel my order but told I would need to wait 10 days for a refund.  While waiting I asked for case to be escalated to a manager.  Was told this would need approval.  Waited longer and no contact.  Called again and got told my escalation had been approved and I would be contacted within the next 48 hours.  No contact made so chased again.  Got told I was going to be emailed by said manager because their phone was not working.  Received email which I replied to but no response from them in a week.  I am still waiting for a refund over a month later and was told yesterday my order should show up as cancelled and I will get my refund in the next 9 days.  This has now been over a month.  This is absolutly ridiculous as order was meant to be a present for my son for the effort he has put in for sitting his A levels - his first exams due to the pandemic.I will never shop directly with Nike again and the fact this cannot be escalated and dealt with by a manager is absolutely ridiculous.

Absolute poor and shocking customer…,John Gardner PT,1,"Absolute poor and shocking customer service! A faulty pair of trainers that cost £280 and they won’t exchange them even after admitting their is a fault, only thing they can offer is a gift card for what I paid and I can purchase again even though the trainers are £80 more expensive now but somehow that is on me to pay because I purchased from an authorised dealer! Manager refused a call back as their terms and conditions state gift card not exchange so customer will be out of pocket! Out of principle the trainers will be thrown in the bin rather than getting anything else and promoting the brand! Now I’m 1 person and makes zero difference to a company like Nike however people should be made aware of the misleading and pathetic terms and conditions as they are pointless and sound great “oh 2 year warranty” but in reality that means absolutely nothing!

Told me to wait a few days for the other pair to be scanned.A few days passed and still no refund for second pair, I was then told by nike to send my proof of postage.Sent my proof of postage and was told they would investigate…A few days later I received a email to confirm outcome of investigation and was told after a thorough search of warehouse they could not find my return, would not be refunding me and to make a claim via Royal Mail.Unable to make a claim via Royal Mail as nike supplied the postage.Back to nike only to be told they can’t refund due to decision of senior team and when they receive the trainers only then will they refund me.I HAVE PROVIDED YOU PROOF OF POSTAGE THAT SHOWS THE WEIGHT OF RETURN SO I HAVE CLEARLY RETURNED BOTH PAIRS YOU NEED TO REFUND ME.HOW CAN TWO PAIRS OF TRAINERS BE SENT AND YOU ONLY RECEIVE ONE PAIR? Surly should someone have intercepted my parcel they wouldn’t of just took one pair and tapped the parcel back up for it to continue its journey to nike returns department.Suddenly investigation was reopened with senior team and I received a refund with a 10% discount of future order.Haha you can stick it, disgusting customer care won’t be shopping nike again.

Unbelievably frustrating, have contacted them on a weekly basis still nothing. I have now asked for them to return them to me and I shall take them to a shop to be refunded. Still waiting for the shoes and told I have to wait! The customer service department apparently cannot contact the warehouse for updates. I highly doubt I will get them back, I doubt they even know where they are. Don’t bother using the pre paid return service, from my experience and seeing similar reviews you are unlikely to see a refund or your item returned! Will never buy from Nike again!Update!

All for profits sake. I have read many making the final choice to never bury again. More people need to be fed up and at least try other brands to see what they are missing when purchasing from Nike. I could not be more disgusted at my last four to five purchases! It took that many bad shoes and experienced to get out of my marketing and advertising slumber. I am now wide  awake, and I am  well aware of how I have been cheated. I will not mention the other brands I have tried and found superior by a mile. None are made in china, is all I will say. Not an advert for others. Just a fact. Nike shoes are uncomfortable and do not look or function  like the marketing states.

NIKE customer service is a joke,James,1,"NIKE customer service does not offer any assistance other than to tell me to wait for my refund. When I stress there is clearly an issue with my return I am told a senior team will ""investigate"" and contact me - they never do. This has been some of the worst service I have ever received. Now they won't offer me any further assistance.I returned an online order 23 days ago using a supplied pre-paid label and still do not have a refund. Every time I have chased NIKE regarding this I am told I need to wait for them to receive the returned package, when I have explained that I have made the return but the item is not tracking beyond my drop off I am told a senior team will ""investigate"" and contact me - they never do.It looks like the return package is lost or stolen because it has not moved from drop off and NIKE have not received it. Now NIKE supplied me the pre-paid returns label so the contract for shipping is between them and collectplus. NIKE do not agree and is now telling me to make a claim with collectplus. Collectplus have told me I need to take it up with NIKE!When I pushed online chat for an answer from the senior team I am also informed that they have ruled that the return label does not show the package weight so they do not accept my photo evidence (which they asked for) so won't refund - THEY SUPPLIED ME THE LABEL! How is it my fault it doesn't show the weight?! I don't understand the weight on label issue, perhaps NIKE thinks I am trying to defraud them but I have sent the package back exactly as I received it and have an e-receipt to prove it - what else can I possibly do?!So I'm caught in a loop and out of pocket for a lot of money. NIKE won't refund until they get the return package, the return package is lost/stuck, NIKE won't help with this, collectplus refer me back to NIKE. Now I have to pursue this with my credit card and the consumer watchdog.Terrible, terrible service.",2023-06-13T14:22:52.000Z,Nike

Nike will repeatedly deny providing a refund,Green,1,"Just read Rohaan Aftabs review of 7 Jun ‘Nike denying refunds when you successfully return items’ I too have just had the same experience. Returned item utilising Royal Mail 48hr tracked label Nike provided. Have proof of postage, proof of weight, and proof of delivery utilising the RMail tracking code. Nike firstly informed me no parcel had been returned. After repeated calls, online chats requesting the refund and sharing all my proof, I’ve now been told an empty box arrived at the warehouse. I was told same info as Rohaan, that I needed to contact RMail to dispute this. I did complete paperwork for a RMail dispute (this will take 30 days) but know the end result will be the same as Rohaan’s experience since the return label was provided by Nike, THEY need to follow up with their preferred courier, in this case RMail, not we as the Nike end customer. I have proof of the weight of the box at the time of dropping the parcel at the RMail office but repeatedly get told by Nike I dropped off an empty box?!. I have now also had to complete an online form with my bank to try to recover the refund Nike owe. Nike are like talking to a hard, cold wall. At the start of an interaction you go from ‘thank you for being a member’ to, when asking for the refund ‘we will end the chat now and help other customers who actually need our support‘. This was my first and last order form Nike. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS ORGANISATION",2023-06-08T16:45:08.000Z,Nike
Pretty Good In General,Mrs Reznor,4,My experience with Nike has been good. Orders have been delivered correctly and on time. I particularly LOVE the custom Air Max’s and Air Force One’s I designed and purchased. I guess my only gripe is the prices. Why do I invariably find Nike items cheaper at other reputable online stores? Third party retailers need to add their cut to the prices in order to make a profit so how can they sell cheaper?! The answer is presumably that Nike are making massive profits out of us. I’ll continue searching other retailers before purchasing directly from Nike.,2023-06-07T23:46:43.000Z,Nike
THEY DENY REFUNDS WHEN YOU SUCCESSFULLY RETURN ITEMS,Rohaan Aftab,1,"So after seeing a few people with the same return problems I will share my experience. I returned part of my order in late march, the item was returned, however nike are claiming they have not received it. They advised me to contact royal mail to get a refund so I messaged royal mail support on twitter asking where my return was and they stated that ''Due to the length of time that's passed since it was posted, it would now be considered lost'', they also said that as the service used was tracked returns, Nike should work with royal mail and refund me. However, i then went back to nike with this information and was shockingly told that NOTHING could be done as they have ‘ not received my return’. Essentially, nike told me to contact royal mail for a refund and royal mail told me to contact nike for a refund so I am completely stuck. I did EVERYTHING perfectly as I should, I had the QR code scanned at my local post office, packed the items securely and kept a drop off/ proof of sending receipt safe.I then opened a PayPal case which was closed in Nikes favour some how but luckily American express with the best customer support and protection in the game closed a claim in my favour. This was probably the worst return experience I have ever had and after 5+ years shopping with Nike I will be staying well away from returning and purchasing online. Also I may add they have ABYSMAL CHAT SUPPORT. It’s a shame because their clothes are genuinely good but my lord stay away from online returns, shameful from some a large business whereas adidas on the other hand I’ve never had a bad experience with.",2023-06-07T15:13:26.000Z,Nike

I've been waiting for months to order the panda Dunks, when they came back in stock I ordered them straight away and they were estimated to be delivered by Evri 2 days later.

It's now 10 days after the original delivery date and after getting in touch with Nike they concluded they are ""lost in the post"" and wanted to refund me or I could wait 10 days to investigate it with Evri. They've  plainly been taken by someone at Evri and this is obviously happening a lot from reading reviews below. is very disappointing from a company that is this big that they aren't bothered about sending what I've ordered. They also couldn't send a replacement as they're now out of stock and couldn't advise me when a restock would be. I missed drops on other websites too as I trusted Nike to deliver me what I ordered.

I was waiting for Air Jordan's 14 Laney to be released for over tge year and when they finally released them the sneakers weren't available in Europe.

Now the same sneakers can be purchased only on Stockx or Kicks for more than double the price plus delivery costs and additional customs costs. This is so unfair and discriminating and I'm thinking to delete my Nike account and move to Adidas or some other brand even though I don't like their products but at least they don't discriminate anyone.if there was 0 I'd give it as as score because of that discrimination.,2023-06-03T18:49:27.000Z,Nike

In store order for delivery gone wrong.

He happen to be the one that I originally paid and ourchased from the prior week so knew my order. I let him know I had not received them. He chased up what happened and called back to apologise that their Brisbane store accidentally sent it to them at Mt Gravatt store instead of my home address. He did give me the option of refund or to ship it out or I could pick up. As I was wanting to use my shoes I opted to pick up in store. However, I arrived and they had the wromg colour. I ordered black They had white. They checked my order and apologised as they had requested the correct colour but said their Brisbane store sent the incorrect colour. By then it didn't matter which store was at fault. I had wasted my time and money to drive 30 kms to collect shoes that weren't there. I am still without shoes.

NO BOXES ANYMORE? HUGELY DISAPPOINTING!,Jules,2,"I am a collector of Nike (mostly) trainers in the UK. My husband bought a pair of Nike Motive training shoes, new model, looked fantastic online etc. Always had a great experience previously. HOWEVER, When they arrived this morning, they came in a box. I opened it up, expecting to see another (the real) trainer box inside. Instead, ALL I SAW WERE THE TRAINERS, NO INTERNAL BOX. So, I wouldn't mind as much (well being a collector I probably would mind), if the costs Nike have saved were passed on to us, the customers. As a real purist where my trainers are concerned, I am literally disgusted that they have cut these out of their products. I love the packaging, always keep it all as good as I can, always put my trainers back in the box at the end of the day and look after my sneaks. I mean, Nike must save LOADS by not giving boxes out. I am quickly going OFF Nike!! I understand we are trying to save the planet but I do feel they are going a bit far here and using that as an excuse to cut their costs and still charge the customers as before. I have already ordered another pair for myself. I did this before I received this pair - I probably wouldn't have ordered anything more from Nike as I feel let down by them now!",2023-06-01T01:20:02.000Z,Nike

I have also had trainers delivered fast and I have a fair few pairs that are great quality.

Nike website is rarely up to date with online inventory,Patrice,2,"Nike website is rarely up to date with actual items available. Always allowing you to place order, and then days later emails you to say order has been cancelled, prompting you to contact them if this is an error. Of course it’s an error i ordered it and YOU cancelled it. Customer rep informs me the item i order is low or out of stock and they can’t place a new order. So why was i allowed to place it in the first place? This is the third time I’ve experienced this poor service from Nike. Sitting on millions but can’t update inventory on their website, causing thousands of customers frustration when they believe they have ordered a product that is in fact sold out. And the email informing me of the cancelled order gave me zero insight. Wasting more of my time by having to call customer service. Which led to more disappointment by saying they can’t order the items either.",2023-05-27T21:48:17.000Z,Nike

No apology from their customer service agents, just a constant sense of being brushed off and the Live Chat agents actually cut-off the chat when I tried to raise a complaint about the poor service. They said they would issue a refund but it still hasn't arrived in my account. Really shocked and disappointed by the appalling customer service - not what I would have expected from Nike.

Delivery status kept saying it's been returned to sender without even attempting to deliver the item, each order tracking shows that it has not been out for delivery. Once Nike receives it they can't send the item back to me and I have to wait 5-8 working days for a refund. The item was sent via DPD and Nike told me that if DPD can't deliver the item that day they have to send the item back to Nike so it doesn't get stolen or damaged. After each refund nike tell me to place another order, only for the same thing to happen again. It's so inconvenient and why do I have to keep waiting for refunds and reordering when the items can just be resent to me? I'm not going to order again, not that it makes a difference to Nike sales but as a Nike member it's makes no difference on the level of service you receive.

Don't buy online I bought goods online…,A Christou,1,Don't buy online I bought goods online as I purchased at a 25% discount if I sign up and bought another item half price . They sent the socks but the tracksuit 'got stuck' waited two weeks then they cancelled it and I had to wait 13 days in total to get a refund. Nike expected me buy online again while waiting for a refund of a gift card. So I would end up with spending another 150 and left with another refund of 136 in vouchers. therefore no sale item and spending £300 . No offer of compensation just the same 25% that has to be used online all new customers will get to sign up. I asked for the 25% to be used instore due to the fact they are not trustworthy. They refused.I topped up my voucher to get a further 10% discount they offer. I could have got the tracksuit cheaper elsewhere minus the extra 10 % voucher. Next online store? when something like this happens and you lose out send you a gift card to compensate for the loss Nike don't care about customer care from my experience now and in the past.

I then decided to contact Nike Assist by telephone (26/04), the previous comms had been through the chat, to be told that I had to provide my bank statement as proof of purchase and that was all they required. This was sent immediately, phoned again on 28/04 to be told to send it as a pdf, I was also informed at this point that the fault claim had been accepted on 10/04. Today (5/5) I have contacted them again to be told they will escalate to a senior member as I requested and a gift card should be processed within 5 days. I asked to speak to a senior manager but was told that was not possible, the operator then put me on hold and spoke to the senior manager!! Apparently I will now have my gift card sent to me within the next 24 hrs.At no point through this claim has Nike contacted me directly to ask for any further information or to provide an update on my claim.  I have had to contact them to progress this claim, if I hadn’t done this I would expect I would still be waiting. I understand that things can take time to progress but why state it will take 5-7 business days and then keep communicating different timescales.I will be surprised if I receive the gift card, this has just been poor communication and customer service and not what I expect from a Global company such as Nike.",2023-05-05T17:30:47.000Z,Nike

In addition to telling me that they could not resolve the matter, the two times I called, the operators were not able to provide me with a telephone contact of the shipping company, they could not find it.Nike's solution: refund the money. I told him that I didn't want the money but the product because it was a gift and that it was very difficult to buy it and the answer was always the same, that as the product was out of stock, they could only refund me.A company with this size should pay attention to the companies they work with.

Their customer support was not helpful either, with the only explanation given that 'they didn't want the trainers to get stolen' and that 'it might come back in stock' but with no guarantee or anything on timing. The best they could offer was a 10% promo code like that would make up for everything. I'd been tracking these trainers for ages and now I can't find them anywhere.

I have a news for Nike: women and men who protest against gender ideology and its illogical, misogynistic, homophobic ideas are not bad people, are not ‘Nazi’, are not transphobes. We are just normal people who are tired to be erased, we are tired to see women’s rights nullified, we are tired to see our language changed, we are tired to be imposed what to think, how to talk, how to behave in order to accommodate some mentally ill people who are violent and abusive towards women.

Nike is just overall bad at customer loyalty,Anil Özer,1,"Nike is just overall bad at customer service. I had purchased an item, and within 2 days, the item was cancelled due to no efficient stock. Then, when I viewed the item again, it was in stock and I could once again purchase it, like what? This happened not once, but a few times. Plus, compared to the sports band with three stripes, their products are inferior. I really like that three stripes have usually a more affordable price, but also are much longer lasting. Not only this, but they stand behind their products, whereas nike is like, ye whatever, the whole world is using our products so we don't have to care about singular customers. I also contacted the CEO and basically did not get a reply by the way. Nike? More like NEVER again.",2023-04-04T08:00:32.000Z,Nike

I was asked for an image of the tracking and then they asked for proof of purchase even though I gave them the ref number they wanted an actual screenshot to prove I bought it! So they have refused to refund even though I have proof it was delivered but icing on the cake was customer service signing off the email telling me to shop in store in future if I plan to purchase any Nike items. Incredibly rude and unhelpful- done purchasing anything from Nike",2023-04-03T23:26:52.000Z,Nike

Then I contact customer care, they treat me as a test subject why don't you try this and that? This time the customer care agent asked me to try three different browsers by logging out and clearing the cache, creating a new account and doing the same thing on the mobile application, uninstalling, then installing again then doing the same thing. After spending half an hour with them, it still DIDNT WORK. Then they ask me to wait a day. What I see the next day was that a few items that I wanted to buy are out of stock.SERIOUSLY WHAT THE HECK !!!NIKE, why the hell do you give a payment option that doesn't work at all? Why the hell you don't treat the customers with respect? When I reported the issue the first time why you couldn't fix it? Not at all happy with your customer service.",2023-04-01T18:21:39.000Z,Nike

Child labour equals poor quality,Chris Panikkou,1,Unfortunately my new pair of trainers were a tad too small. I believe the child that made them needs to be reprimanded and have 20 cents deducted from their monthly wage packet of a dollar. Overall a poor experience due to small hands and a lack of perception from the child labourer who produces 1000s of pairs of trainers for a pittance of pay. No incentive equals a lack of quality from the child labourer. 🧐🤗,2023-03-26T14:55:32.000Z,Nike

The managers never call you back I’m surprised if they even have managers. Honestly the worst customer service I have ever received - if I ever manage to get this sorted I will be deleting my Nike account and never shopping from them again.

Placed a big order,Meg,1,"Placed a big order. 3rd jan, I got a text saying my order will be delivered between 12.46-1.46. At 9.53, I informed them via their link to deliver the parcel the next day as no one will be home all day and night. At 18.09, I got a text saying it has been delivered. It was left on my front door step. When I returned home, the parcel wasn’t there. We live in London, so it isn’t a clever thing to do to leave the parcel unattended outside. Nike escalated this order and rejected the refund saying the DPD told them it was “delivered correctly”. I contacted dpd and they emailed me saying they’ve admitted liability and refunded nike for their costs on that delivery. Nike, for a big company, lied to me to take the money from me and Dpd. Until I showed them evidence, they didn’t refund me. The agents on the phone and assistants on the chat will literally just say “sorry the seniors have denied a refund and that’s it”. Just one assistant, called elena, understood finally and refunded me. what a joke. There is no chance I’m ordering online again!!!",2023-02-18T14:21:58.000Z,Nike

Go through your bank and ask for a  charge back,Mr Astwood,1,Effectively Nike use a call centre to process there complaints and returns and they are just given a Script and probably have nothing to do with Nike itself. I purchased a pair of trainers that fell apart after first use so I contacted them via chat as that is all you can do I was then told I could return them as they were faulty. I was sent a prepaid Royal Mail return label and sent it I then waited 5 days checked the tracking and it said it was delivered they then contacted me and said I sent an empty box which is a complete lie as I have the weight on the receipt which I sent to them and they didn’t respond I then contacted them again and they said there’s nothing they can do and won’t send a refund. So effectively they now have my trainers I sent they have refused me a refund and have called my a lier. I contacted my bank and they said it’s something they can do and are issuing a charge back on my transaction. I recommend doing this if you want your money back I hope this helps.

Then when I tracked it all it kept says was ""there's been an exception on your parcel"" now today 6 weeks later its saying ""parcel on way back to sender"" If Nike do not refund me by close of play this week I'm going to file a claim at the small claims court.

Go somewhere else to buy Nike if you are a Nike person,Zach Schoeber,1,"I just want to say that dealing with Nike has become complete bullsh*t. My order has now taken almost 5 day to even send out and still hasn’t been sent . I understand that maybe this shoe needs to be sent in from somewhere else ? Maybe it’s not readily available at a warehouse? Or maybe you guys are backed up ? In my opinion there is no excuse at all. U have the shoe on your website as if it is available. I payed for the shoe as if it was available without the knowledge that it would take forever to even ship. The website is dogsh*t Most of the time I dread ordering from Nike.com cause I know it will take forever so most of the time it’s a last resort. And On top of that your inventory on your website is complete trash.The fact that you can’t go to the actual source , the actual brand Nike , to get there premium selections without being mislead and clicking in the item only to realize that it’s not even in stock is rediculous.  And you have shoes still up as if there in stock and u click on the shoe and then it tells you not available. All Nikes shoe selections have been so bad lately as well. I hope someone Important can see this because I’m actually a huge Nike fan and supporter and at this point I’m frustrated enough to write this to let u guys know that I’m about done with the half a** service and selections.

Website function is terrible,Christina Cumpian,1,"Took a couple days to get one of the two digital gift cards that I ordered that was supposedly going to be emailed to me in ""approximately 2 hours or less"". After I ordered the digital gift card and hadn't received anything for a while, I was told by a representative that for some reason Nike had canceled the transaction (much to my surprise since I received no email from them indicating that it had been canceled). I also still haven't received the second gift card. It really doesn't make sense to me that as big of a company as Nike is, they can't send digital gift cards automatically after purchase and that their website functions very poorly. The only reason why I paid for digital Nike gift cards in the first place was that I tried ordering shoes with visa gift cards and the website wouldn't accept more than one visa gift card as payment for the transaction. I know better next time to just go to a retailer.*Update: I ended up talking with another chat agent earlier today about still having not received the second digital card I ordered. Through a quick process, the agent sent me another gift card, and oddly started flirting with me afterward (just seemed a little unprofessional and off the wall). Later on, I tried ordering shoes online with the gift cards and kept receiving an error message. I ended up talking to another agent on the phone who, after trying it from their end and talking with a supervisor, was unable to figure out why the transaction wasn't going through. I'm not blaming the agent as she was saying that Nike wasn't giving a detailed description of why the transaction wasn't going through. However, it does go to show how seemingly outdated and dysfunctional the Nike website/order processing system is, which really doesn't make sense with how big a corporation it is.",2023-01-03T15:08:47.000Z,Nike

I would have been happy to send the trainers back and simply recieved a gift card. Order number, email were both presented along with mobile number and still they couldn't help.",2023-01-03T13:12:37.000Z,Nike

Bought air max tw size 8.5 on 12/14/22…,Gustavo Sanchez,1,"Bought air max tw size 8.5 on 12/14/22 and they arrived in 4 days smelling like cat urine, I sent them back for an exchange. Nike received the return on 12/24/22 , it is now 1/2/23 and The status of the shoes is stuck at “preparing shipment” I called and what the nike athlete/associate told me was there was no update on my order and that they would “escalate” my order and my worst fears came to fruition after seeing other reviews with similar problems . The most ridiculous part is Nike usually waits until the item is out of stock and just refund you the money but the shoes I wanted had an abundance in stock and STILL couldn’t get them to me. I requested a refund and now im waiting for an “email” to the refund like I’ve been waiting for the “email “ for the shipment of my shoes. What a joke!!",2023-01-03T00:05:22.000Z,Nike

Don't buy big branded names that disregard that people and only focus on skinny people,I'm Angry again 🤬,1,I've been buying Nike for all my life I put on a bit of weight but I'm not that big I'm certainly not obese my weight 11 and a half stones I can't fit in any of the tracksuit I think it's very unfair that nike make clothing for skinny people and not clothing to encourage fat people to go to the gym because we don't have anything to wear down at the gym we just look like wearing tight clothing it's just material Just add more material and make the jacket bigger make the trousers bigger what's wrong with you people that you don't want to see fat people have self-confidence you want us to stay at home saying we need to lose weight before we can go to the gym and look like other people or we have to stick up like a sore thumb coming into the gym with clothes that don't fit you take our money you don't care and then you just focus on making slim skinny people happy you don't actually encourage us to feel good about ourselves we have money we can buy clothes but you don't make the clothes for us you make the clothes for the skinny people shame on you and if I ever shift the weight I will certainly stop myself from ever going to night to shop again because I've seen that your fashion industry is not focused on the people that used to buy your stuff but when we put on a bit of weight  you totally disregarded us like we are nothing if that people could cover up the fat instead of having it bulging out from tight clothing we would be more than happy to spend all day in the gym no nobody is actually looking at our body instead we stay at home depressed because there's nothing to make us look good when we go down the gym while other people are fitting in their Close perfectly we are made to look like some kind of joke because you put extra large in the clothing and it's not for large people it's for slim people with an extra large tag when are you going to do the sports industry a favour and think about what it's like to be fat and want to go down the gym if we just had clothing that would cover up our shame we could work out until we shrink and become what we want to be but if the clothes don't fit and and how would you expect us to go down to the gym booking like mutton dressed as lamb or define some cheap stretchy trouser and a big baggy plain old t-shirt with no name no brand we want fashion we want like signs we want to look good just like other people when we go to the gym wearing fashionable names that we love instead we now take our money and buy a chocolate cake and wallow in misery at home because nobody wants our money when we say we want to buy ourselves a beautiful tracksuit and go down to the gym we have to go there with asking showing stretched out in something tight and everybody laughing up belly is popping out and things like that we just want to be covered up jackets that zip up properly we're good padding in certain places you can't even be bothered to design anything for the bigger person you go on like you are trying to design something for an elephant so you don't bothered to try well we are not elephants we are just humans and we are not over beast we're just a little bit bigger than what you say is extra large or extra extra large you do not cater for women of size you regard us like we are nothing not even worth looking into or we don't actually think of Fashion people should be able to dress in whatever they want but the fashion industry is racist bias non-inclusive rejected because people are a little bit overweight you expect us to Just Lose self-confidence and not want to be part of society I'm fed up of going into your sports shop seeing nice tracksuits made from stretchy material and you can't even add some more material and stitching you think that we want the clothes for free well we have money I'll let you know we can buy these clothes but you don't make them in our size if it's going to cost you more to make them in bigger sizes then put the price up we will pay for the items if they're costing you much more to make we will buy them but first stop your selfish way of thinking and design clothes for fat people we demand change,2022-12-31T22:17:36.000Z,Nike

NIKE.COM is a Total Christmas FAIL - AGAIN!!,A. Webb,1,"For the 3rd year in a row, I have ordered from Nike.com against my better judgment and once again, they failed me. How stupid am I? Still waiting on Christmas gifts that were ordered December 15, long before their Christmas delivery cut-off date - PLUS Paid $20 to expedite shipping..yet still haven't received any of it 2 weeks later. I have called customer service and that was no help. They blamed it on the snowstorm, and yet every other company I ordered from got my stuff here on time. Plus, FedEx still says they have never received the package from Nike. (You can't blame a snowstorm when the package was never actually shipped, Nike.) I will NOT order from them again and will try to cancel this order. As I said, this has happened to me for 3 Christmases in a row: 2020, 2021 and 2022 despite the fact that they guarantee Christmas delivery each time. I'm convinced they are selling items that don't yet exist and then scrambling to catch up. PLUS I just read that they continue to have a poor track record for human rights abuses in their factories. Yet another very good reason to avoid this company in the future.",2022-12-29T10:34:20.000Z,Nike

Rang Nike call centre in Egypt (there is no British based help line) There were language barriers. I was told the trainers would be with me within 24hours. Still not received 21 December so rang again. Someone answered but did not speak to me so rang again. The second person said that they were lost and they would give me a refund. I said I did not want a refund as they are a christmas present. She told me she would send another pair and asked me the size. She came back to me to say that there were no 8's so she would give me a refund and I could get another pair and gave me a 20 per cent off. I asked if I could spend this at a shop to which she replied no. I said I cannot order on line as she had told me there were no 8s. She said that I could.  When i finished the call i went on line to see if the trainers were in stock in his size and they were not available.This went on for  some time. I asked for a manager to ring me back and this has not happened. My son does not now have his christmas present.

Awful customer service.,Matt Seymour,1,"Awful customer service.I ordered a pair of fairly expensive fly knit trainers which were due for delivery over a week ago.Received an email advising of dispatch, and upon continually checking the couriers app (DPD) it was apparent that parcel hadn’t left warehouse and courier was ‘expecting it’.I made 5 calls to various ‘customer service agents’ and advised them that parcel was not in the delivery system and hadn’t even left the warehouse, but was continually fobbed of, and advised it was ‘ in the system’.Eventually managed to contact DPD,  who confirmed that the parcel had never been received by them.I was eventually able to speak to a Nike agent today, who confirmed that parcel had not left warehouse.A replacement had been issued, and they couldn’t even offer a next day delivery .This was meant to be a Christmas present that will now not arrive in time.Really bad service.",2022-12-19T12:59:43.000Z,Nike

Fast shipping and shoes are the right…,Jessica Baptiste,4,Fast shipping and shoes are the right size BUT when the package came in the shoes were all over the place in the big box not the shoe boxes. Should have packed in a smaller box and put paper or something so the shoes didnt come out the shoe boxed when tossed around from ups. These were gifts so kinds embarrassing that they will open the shoe box to a brand new pair of AF1 to see the shoe box paper not looking fresh and neat. Hence the 4star review but other than that it was extremely fast shipping which I’m happy about. Font order from Hibbetts they take for ever and still don’t have a package i ordered on the days as i did with nike.,2022-12-18T10:56:35.000Z,Nike

Nike's online fulfilment is clearly not fit for purpose.,matthew,1,"Nike has fallen a very long way indeed. From global sporting brand super power to literally one of the worst brands/retailers. The UK warehouse clearly cannot cope with the orders it is receiving. Placed a first order for 2 pairs of leggings waited 5 days..no dispatch email, no tracking... Live chat reported that the order had been 'lost'... Immediately 'dispatched' a second order...Guess what? 11 days later.. No sign of the order, back to live chat, turns out that the order hadn't been shipped at all... Asking for a full refund to be told that ""Normally I have to make you wait 10 days after the estimated delivery due date which is December 12th...""  which was 4 DAYS AGO.....  SO can't give a refund because i should wait another 6 days...I ask for a tracking number... ah yes.. It hasn't actually been shipped!!  SO in essence me, the customer, has to wait, in total 17 days before i can get a refund for an order that Nike never shipped in the first place?!!  Wow...

A gesture as useful as a chocolate teapot!,Carly,1,"I have to say that I am totally disappointed for such a large reputable company to have such a poor customer service system, I ordered products in the black Friday sales total should have been £301 but with the discounts it came to £179,this parcel went missing and being Christmas presents for my niece and daughter I was keen to re-order the items, Unfortunately the only thing Nike could offer was to refund me ( this would take up to 9 days to reach my account), I could then replace my order with a 20% discount code and hope everything turned up on time. the issue with this gesture for me is that, I don't have £240 (£60 more than my original order) spare this time of year to place the order that has been lost and also its not actually a good will gesture when I have to spend more money before my refund arrives and also risk not getting presents on time anyway. this to me was about as much use as a chocolate teapot! all i wanted was for them to process the order again from their end with the correct discount applied and free next day shipping, which should be easy for a company of their size and status........",2022-12-16T11:19:05.000Z,Nike

I used the chat service to chase to then be told my order was cancelled on 01/12 for which i received no notification. I paid using a mix of gift card and credit card. the 1st advisor informed be it was bank issue and to contact my bank. The next advisor said it was an issue with my gift cards. They have no clue! I've now reordered using the same payment methods. The options i have is to escalate a complaint which could take 7 days or let the advisor monitor the order for 48 hours to see if it processes. If it doesn't progress, it will get escalated and guess what, it'll be upto 9 days then. Nike are happy to cash gift cards without notifying customers that orders have been cancelled.

When asked to speak to a manager I’m being told they don’t have a complaints department, I’ll just have to wait, I have no faith or trust this refund is arriving, I’m waiting to purchase a tracksuit for my son for Christmas which will never arrive in time, I’m offering solutions and having no support at all with this.

This Bias Incident at Nike Company Store,Heather,1,"This evening, my family and I visited the Nike Employee Store and I experienced poor treatment due to my disability. On crutches and wearing a boot on my right foot, I was told I would not be able to sit down inside the store because I would get ""in the way"". After searching for several minutes, an employee found a chair and told me I could sit in a hallway used as a fire exit. But, since I'd be blocking the exit, I'd have to leave if requested. Due to this unacceptable treatment, my family and I chose to leave the store. I've been unable to contact management, the store's phone will not pick up or accept messages. I chatted with a representative at Nike.com and they could not provide me any contact information for store management.I believe it's important for disabled members of our society to know that Nike had embraced ableist policies and is not willing to make accommodations at their employee store.",2022-12-14T04:10:32.000Z,Nike

Went back on the live chat  and was assured that I would receive the refund by today (2 weeks later) STILL NOTHING. have gone back onto the chat to speak to someone today and was told again that they would process the refund absolutely shocking customer service after trying to explain my frustration to this person on the live chat they just ended it… shocking when your job is meant is focused on ‘customer experience’ Called up and spoke to a nice representative called Kalin who sincerely apologised for this and could see that none of the times I requested a refund was it actually processed.

"For such as a big company, customer service and returns is awful.",AB,1,"Nike is a huge company making so much money but when it comes to getting a refund. They are a nightmare. Tracking clear shows they have received it but their customer service tells you to wait up to 2 weeks before they can even initiate refund process. None of the other companies take this long. Some companies even initiate the refund on the spot as a goodwill gesture. Definitely not buying from Nike again and going to other companies that never have this problem.Update two (15/12/22):They told me to wait till today to reach out. After telling them the tracking numbers that are generated on the order page. They still required photos of the post office receipts. Surely they can just input the tracking numbers onto Royal Mail webpage to check?After contacting them again with the photos, they have now sent the photos of the same tracking numbers to a senior team for processing. They asked for another 3-5 working days which means at this rate, it takes at least 1 whole month since sending it back to receive refund. This is assuming there's no issues. Nike has the worst customer service I have experienced out of all the many places I have shopped. I would definitely recommend Adidas or Reebok in the future, they make great shoes and customer service is so much better.",2022-12-12T11:40:52.000Z,Nike

Utterly appalling customer service,RebeccaM,1,"Utterly appalling customer service, having followed up on an email on  9th December 2022 stating that my order had been ""cancelled or returned."" This was a very much sought after Christmas present for my son. Nike Customer Services could not offer a reasonable explanation as to why it had cancelled,  despite that I had email confirmation with a tracking number and inform of dispatch. I was then advised later that day of the following - ""Hello! I think we got disconnected. I discussed the matter with my supervisor and it is possible that the automatic refund was triggered because the item was shortly unavailable for dispatch. However, this money will be back in your account within 9 working days. I am very sorry for this situation, it does not usually happen.""The following day on 10th December 2022, I recieved a further email - ""Thanks for your order. Your payment overview is attached.* (If we send more than one package, you might see more than one payment overview notice.) You can track your package here. We’ll get your shipment to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, feel free to contact us with any questions.Nike.com"" Confusing to say the least, does this mean I can still expect the package? No......The link does not allow to 'track your package', only showed the order remains 'returned.' No idea if I am to actually expect the package now or whether I will recieve refund in a timely manner. I have lost confidence in Nike and will not be purchasing from them again. I would advise anyone considering purchase for Christmas, as it is doubtful you will recieve item or your money back in time to remedy their error.

My order never arrived and hasn’t been refunded 6weeks later,Adria Davis,1,"My order never arrived, I chased it up and eventually found out it had been lost in transit. Nike said they would cancel the order (which I would presume also means processing a refund for it) and I would need to place the order again. They gave me a discount code for the inconvenience which I was going to use, and at that point I would’ve been a happy customer. However, since then Nike haven’t let Klarna know that they cancelled my order so now Klarna think I owe them £400. The order was placed on 29th Oct. We’re in mid December now. I’ve contacted Klarna, they tell me to speak to Nike. Nike have been ignoring my emails dated 15 Nov and 04 Dec. I’ve rang the Nike customer service line twice and both times I have been unable to hear what the service agent is saying, either because of the fuzzy line, the level of English language or a combination of the two. I’m sorry to bring this up but it’s a problem as it’s caused even more frustration at this situation and it’s the only mode of communication you offer on your website.

I go on fourth day, and really out of my way to get them too. Owner says shoes have been returned to Nike upon UPS request. Says UPS doesn't let the shops keep for more than two days (??). Says I have to call UPS. Gives me UPS number. My kid now doesn't have his trainers for his birthday the next day. Kid in tears. Spend ages on phone to UPS. They eventually tell me shop owner refused to even accept the delivery in the first place. Going round in circles and plenty confusion. I call Nike: 1. Why wasn't I notified that shoes aren't there? 2. Why aren't they there? 3. Kid's birthday ruined 4. I have to now spend more the next day trying to make it up to him 5. Have now spent hours of time I don't have driving around and calling trying to resolve. Nike rep says he'll get everything sorted out and agrees I should be compensated. So maybe I will return to Nike after this. 5 days go by....no word, no email, no call...I email. No reply. I email again...and again....and again..... Finally today call again, have to go through the whole thing yet again. Very sweet rep can't apologise enough, refunds immediately and compensates 20% off next purchase.

Nike The Narcissist,Danielle Cheyenne,1,I’m so dissatisfied with Nike the company as a whole is horrible I know it’s not the employees fault or the customer service representatives but every time I make a purchase if I have to do it in exchange for whatever reason usually sizing or quality they seem to never get my order right or actually send me my return they just give you your money back and then tell you that they’re out of stock they never know when they’re going to be in stock so you can’t ever get what you want and then whenever you call and speak about it they have no recollection of verification you ever called it’s like it’s nonexistent I just feel like I was working with a narcissist like they gaslighted me the whole entire time every time,2022-12-06T23:54:20.000Z,Nike

Jorden 6 rings toddler horrible condition zero rating if it was possible,Taisha,1,If I was able to give the rating a zero I would with no problem. I have ordered a pair of Jorden Rings 6 Atmosphere/ Black/White/Infrared 23 toddler for my niece size 6 C the condition of the shoes I have to say they were in horrible condition the white part of the shoes had black marks on one shoes than the other shoes was even finish I was able to see dry glue at the corners of the head of the shoes. I’m very disappointed in the condition my shoes came in. I even spoke to customer services and blame the shipping process which made no sense because my box was even destroyed its very unacceptable and inconvenient that I have to return these shoes due to inaccurate inspection on Nike end which this wasn’t done correctly seem like they don’t really care about there products at all if they able to send out shoes unfinished but marks on the shoes . I’ll be returning these and going else where I recommend kids foot locker. I wouldn’t recommend shopping online with Nike thats if you want incomplete product either do a pick order so your able to return that item. I hope no customer has to experience the condition my shoes were in. It just shows that it doesn’t matter to them if they lose out on one customer sense they profit no matter what so differences it makes. Nike has really given up on the quality care and attention to details on their product.,2022-12-06T18:57:09.000Z,Nike

Or they are sitting around on mountains of boxes wondering why no-one orders anything.I even called them and their -- useless, of course -- suggestion was to 'try paypal' (nope, doesn't work). Hopeless.An annoying, expensive (in terms of my time -- for which I am normally paid) waste of time.

Please tell me how I am supposed to send these back now?The whole returns process is an utter joke!!!I requested to be put through to the complaints team and eas told there isn't one.I requested to be put through to a manager and was told that wasn't possible and that if a manager wanted to then I would get a call back!!!So Nike... where do I go from here?

That’s great apart from the fact that if I do that I now can’t deliver on my daughters Xmas present. It’s not hard to make sure your products are fit for sale and meet quality standards.

But how about this, couple hours later I got an email that the order (after winning that nearly impossible to enter raffle) is cancelled because it is out of stock?When I contacted the customer service, the reply was the stock was out when my order entered, meaning Nike already sold the stock to elsewhere before the winners of the draw can even get to it? Shouldn’t a predetermined amount of stock be allocated for this raffle prior to the draw? It just blows my mind how there is a draw of which the prize is not even available from start?",2022-11-22T05:30:14.000Z,Nike
Bad order experience,Natalija Snapkauskaite,2,"I ordered a pair of shoes with Nike.com and the experience has been really 'meh'.1. The order tracking was unreliable: information on the order page was not updated, the email notification ""order shipped"" was sent after the order was delivered, and I did not receive ""delivered order"" notification in time to ensure I could pick up the package so it wouldn't be stolen.2. The support team was not able to provide more details on the order than the non-fuctional order page; I would not blame this on a support specialist as I think they might not have the needed information. However, overall it was a disappointing experience.3. Support chat is bugged: I was in the middle of the chat with a customer support specialist; they told me something like ""please wait a minute, I'll get back to you"" and the chat was closed due to me being inactive.4. Shipping is very slow - I was expected much speedier delivery from Nike; in the future, I'd prefer to order from a reseller instead or choose another brand.",2022-11-21T21:16:50.000Z,Nike
Awful customer service,customer,1,I ordered a LA Lakers top for my daughter. She liked the big black zip feature and the top which arrived did not have the thick black zip across the jumper. We complained and said the item was no longer in stock and were offered a 10% discount off a future item. We asked to speak to a manager as wanted a discount off this order not a future order as the error was with Nike. The customer advisor James then ended the chat. Awful service.

Missing item told no refund,Terrie,1,Order 17 items from Nike that were all shipped in separate packages. One package arrived supposed to contain 9 items but only had 8. Having called up about the situation I was then emailed and told I was wrong and the package had been delivered. I then emailed back explaining the package did arrive but 1 item was missing. I was then told that the warehouse team had confirmed the item wasn’t missing and that the weight of the parcel was correct (even though only a T-shirt minimal weight was missing). I have asked for prood if this and had no reply yet. I was told to contact law enforcement for the missing T-shirt even though the package was sealed. What a joke,2022-11-19T21:14:39.000Z,Nike

The items in total cost me £364 which was taken from my accounts immediately after placing the order. I received my order number and then after an hour so saw that the order information page was reading as “preparing shipment” this all seemed well and good until I checked the next day and it still said “preparing shipment.” Okay, I thought, one or two days to pick the items and wrap them up ready for shipping isn’t too bad, I can deal with that, so I check back the next day and the next and the next, each day saying the same thing thing. The order was expected to arrive on the 11th. When I tried to contact Nike about it through the useless online chat service I received no help whatsoever, they palmed me off saying that they can’t do anything as they don’t know anything about anything at all and it’s their policy to make me wait 3-5 days for any information with regards to my order status. All I can say is that I’ll never shop with Nike again, infact I’ll probably sell the gear second hand and stop supporting this shambolic excuse for a brand.",2022-11-15T12:43:54.000Z,Nike

Next day, same thing cancelled it again. Keep in mind they’re KEEPING A HOLD ON MY CARD the whole time. So they have almost $1000 of my money, and see no problems keeping it for 10 days, when ZERO services were rendered. It’s basically robbery. They offer nothing as far as reconciliation.

I sent the wrong item back after contacting nike via live chat to explain I haven’t received two items and sent proof of postage as requested. 3 months later and 7 different live chats and phone calls I’ve not received my items or my money back. Customer Service is the worst I’ve ever experienced. Every time I’ve asked what’s going on they keep fobbing me off until I think they believe will just give up complaining. I’m owed two expensive items and I’d like to know what has gone wrong. Yet it’s nigh on impossible to formally complain.

Seriously Nike!! I trusted ur product, did not have a problem paying for it that hard earned $200 and u do not trust a picture from a damaged product to be emailed to you!! The Rebacca that I guys hired at the customer service to be the manager clearly said it is the costumers’ problem they trusted Nike they said.

As it's a birthday present, I re-ordered, but this time I wanted to pick them up a Nike store. The email said delivery date will be 3rd November.  I enter the store, provide my delivery details, NO ITEM IN STORE! P***ed but no panic! Later I contacted Nike Customer Services and I'm told ""They'll be there tomorrow!"" It's not acceptable, but hey I tried to be patient. I checked the delivery status (which wasn't available yesterday), and the F**king shoes are STILL IN BRUSSELS! Are you kidding me!! For the last twenty years (or so), I have sadly watched the demised of this once great brand, and it's really sad! From the poor size restructuring of the clothes (where joggers are coming up short), to the poor staff product knowledge, care and empathy. Clearly not the Nike, that I used to spend ALL my money on in the 90's. That Nike had a feel-good factor about it. This what's here now, is a Horror show!

Half order,Karen Mccarthy,1,"Ordered 2 items from nike online for delivery on the 3rd of Oct 2022 ,received one of my items with the other to follow , on the 12th of October I received a message from the delivery company that my parcel was ready to pick up from a premier store in blackpool , I rang nike cs to be reassured that the lady I spoke to had arranged for the parcel to be delivered to my home , then today I received a further message today 17th of oct saying today is the last chance to pick up my parcel from the premier store named last week , so obviously I rang again , the cs operator stated that I would have to receive a refund as I can't get the parcel redelivered , he said they had tried to deliver the parcel but couldn't for whatever reason , I had already told them in the previous phone call that I am disabled and housebound and could not get to the store or anywhere else for that matter and I live 50 miles away from my family, I was also offered 15% discount for the inconvenience , which I turned down , after the call I remembered that I'd had a delivery last week and when I went to the door the delivery driver had two parcels , after giving me a parcel he knocked on my neighbours door at which point I came back into my home and thought nothing of it ,I didn't open the parcel until the next day as it was a Christmas present ,So there was no rush , when I did open it , it turned out to be chocolates,on checking the name and address it was my neighbours parcel ,immediately I realised the driver got the parcels mixed up, on speaking to my neighbour I found out she didn't know anything about a delivery as she was at work, what I didn't expect was that I wouldn't get my parcel at all , Why would I accept a 15% discount off the nike online store when I can't get what I ordered to begin with , first and last time I use nike online",2022-10-17T16:10:01.000Z,Nike

Avoid Nike,Dawn Collie ,1,"Had to return faulty trainers and reorder a replacement pair as they are ‘unable to exchange goods purchased online’. Weird but ok. Returned faulty pair mid September and receipt of faulty trainers confirmed. However, I’m STILL waiting for a refund. Bearing in mind I had to reorder and pay again for replacement trainers, Nike has taken payment for the second pair immediately but is unable, or unwilling, to process a refund for the faulty shoes. The customer service experience has been shocking when trying to confirm when I should expect a refund; every rep has been very vague and unhelpful in repeating the same mantra of ‘your refund is waiting to be processed’. Seriously, why is it taking so long when you’ve had the returned goods for a month now? It should not be as difficult and time consuming to get my money back for goods bought in good faith that have not been fit for purpose. I’ll be avoiding Nike in future and I suggest others do the same.",2022-10-16T09:43:50.000Z,Nike

I got notification saying they have them and will be delivered as contracted. Following day I got notification saying there’s been a delay and they will try and ensure they are delivered next working day. 6 days nothing???? I contacted Nike and was advised they have 2 days to get delivery too me. I’ve contacted them again today and they have offered a refund or replacement? Ok I’ll take replacement if it’s not Evri? sorry we can’t guarantee it won’t be the same courier? Ok just refund. So moral of story is Nike has had my money now for 10 days. This was a birthday present which did not arrive on time. They offered a replacement but I requested a different courier. They could not offer this? My guess is they have went for the shitest cheapest courier EVRI and they really couldn’t give a Flying F@@K about there customers. My cost my loss no mention of a exgratia payment???

What a shame...,Richard Bridge,1,"I ordered 7 packs of these sock and received only 5. The package arrived with no visible breaks or damage (which would suggest there was no issue with the package in transit). After immediately contacting Nike support I was told that due to the ""weight"" of the package being ""correct"" when it was shipped, they would not be correcting the issue. A further two times contacting them, the two very helpful representatives unfortunately could not help as the warehouse supervisor (from where this was shipped) point blank refused that there was any issue and would no longer pursue the case. This is a total shame as this product is very good. I no longer have any confidence in Nike and would warn future purchasers to video the unpacking process to ensure quantities are correct. If a parcel arrives at your door and has no tampering, you would assume there was an error (which can happen) in packing. I have now unfortunately paid £20.00+ for two items I will never receive.",2022-10-13T15:34:47.000Z,Nike

Absolutely appalling customer service,Oliver George,1,"Absolutely appalling customer service.  Used online chat initially to query an outstanding order only for my chat session to time out as I had to wait for a response from the agent.  Surely it should only time out if they are waiting for me to reply, otherwise the agents can just sit back and let every query expire?  Tried the helpline only to give up after half an hour.  Tried chat again and spoke to an Ericka who offered to cancel my order as the item was out of stock, even though the website still shows them as in stock but now 10gbp more than what I ordered them at.  I did highlight this to the agent who totally blanked this and said she can only authorise cancellation of the order.  So I asked for details on how to lodge a formal complaint and requested my order be fulfilled and they just hung up on me and ended the chat. Out of interest, I went back immediately to the item and ordered at the higher price and magically its gone straight through and will be delivered in a few days.  What an absolute crock of excrement.  This is not the first time this has happened to me and the Nike customer services team couldn't give two hoots about my complaints.  They must be on commission for closed out requests or something.  I advise people to steer clear of the website and order though someone like Footlocker of FootPatrol.

That'll have to wait until next week.Let me explain: The Brooklyn 11 hoody has a very distinctive cut around the neckline. It extenuates the shoulders neck and arms. It has enough body and shape that you can pair it with both tight and loose-fitting jeans. It's dope and I'm confident Kanye West would approve.I made a point to provide a review here because I read these reviews the day after my purchase, and on the strength of the dismal ratings fretted that I'd made a big mistake. I'm here to set the record straight. The parcel arrived on cue (14 days as promised). It may have arrived sooner if it hadn't got held up at NZ customs for a week! But two weeks from Europe or USA, for a clothing parcel? that's good. They provide an ETA based on your location so if you can't bear the thought of waiting 2-3 weeks then don't buy it.

Nike has gone downhill in the past few…,Anita Parisi,1,Nike has gone downhill in the past few years. The quality of the clothing is extremely bad after a few washes. Trackpants I purchased a few weeks ago falling apart pulling threads out each time I wear them. Black clothing especially jumpers already look faded & fade more after only a few washes. They are buying cheap material & charging for it. I won’t be buying any more clothing. Fare enough before the clothes were worth it. Was happy to pay $100 for a new season jumper. But now I look like I wear old clothes just washing items a few times.it’s really disappointing because we have spent thousands over the years. Shoes are good don’t ever have issues with shoes.

They told me the online team would send me packaging to return the item (this turned out later to not be the case!)Eventually they said I could return the product as it was defective. I asked them to send me packaging and a returns label code to print in store as I don't have a printer. They said they don't supply packaging to return (opposite of what the in-store team said) and that I had to print the label - I told them I don't have a printer and they offered no solution. When I told them that I had paid tube fair to go to store and that I would have to pay for packaging to return they didn't care despite this all being their fault - they did offer a 10% off voucher for my next order (as if I would be ordering again after all of this!). When I told the customer service agent on the phone that the person on the online chat originally told me to go to store, she claimed this didn't happen so I asked her to send me the chat history but she wouldn't (isn't this my personal data which I am entitled to see under GDPR regulation?!).

Order never arrived,Kelly,1,Managed to get a pair of Jordans on their release date for my 12 year old daughter. Order never arrived. DPD said Nike did not send them the parcel. Contacted customer service via live chat who said sorry must be lost in transit. Nothing can be done apart from refund. They had my money for 12 days. It took me contacting them to find out what was going on. Asked numerous times to escalate the issue to find out where the item is or source a replacement to which was denied.Apparently looks like you can only speak to first line support at Nike and have to accept whatever response they give you. No second line support no exec support team. Checked my account and they have marked them as refunded as they were returned. Complete lies. Do not even believe they had them in stock in the first place.  Massively annoyed as now have to explain to my daughter shoes will now not arrive.,2022-09-14T15:32:43.000Z,Nike

It’s like JCPenny in 1992🤡,Joseph S.,1,"Nike has a great app, and excellent product but their service after the sale is stuck in the 1990s.Filing for a return and exchange is relatively simple. But they have to receive your return and check your return and then “prepare“ your return before it they will send it. I’ve been waiting on my replacement for three weeks. According to the website they were in stock the day I filed for my return/exchange. This just seems like a bad policy.For example, other online retailers will ship you a replacement item immediately, and give you a window of time to have returned the original item before they charge you for the second item.Example:I had actually ordered the wrong size of baseball pants for my son, Set up a return exchange and had the new pants three days later.  I think most people this day and age would relate to that sort of return exchange policy with the vast majority of online retailers.Why can’t Nike do the same?",2022-09-13T18:34:33.000Z,Nike

"Worst customer care ever, people in England must boycott this company",T,1,"For starters it would be amazing if trustpilot can have no stars or a poop emoji to rate companies like these. Ordered a pair of trainers as a gift and it never arrived. I called the customer care number in UK to see if I could rearrange the delivery and they only know how to say sorry. Offered me a promo code, I will probably ask them to shove it where the sun don't shine. They were meant to come on Wednesday to my door step, instead left it in a pick up location miles away. When asked the representatives they say they can't do much from their end. Might as well pack up and look for opportunities for packing eggs. This is why we shouldn't be brand loyal that's how this companies are taking the mick. I don't know if trading standards can look into all this. Celebrities who are supporting this good for nothing companies should be ashamed of themselves. Sad to say this though, I wish one day Nike would go bankrupt. I am absolutely annoyed with the quality of their service. I don't think anyone from Nike actually read these reviews on trustpilot which says a lot.

After arranging that I went to order the shoes, and then I got a message that Danish Paypal doesn't work when ordering things to Hungary. So I then reached out to a customer service agent. I am chatting with him right now. He is the SLOWEST typer I have ever encountered. I wrote this whole review while waiting for his next message.

Keep in mind my husband and I spend $500 or so a month with Nike. Raymond read me the policy for returns exchanges that says 60 days unworn unused. I said there is a policy for defective workmanship and I said you can look at the chats I contacted within the first month.  He read the policy again verbatim.

He replied supervisors dont take calls and only contact via email.  I said sorry but I dont believe that Nike doesnt care about their customers and dont allow customer agents to provide customer service and said this is a defective product and you are ok with saying too bad so sad and he reread me the policy.

So I contacted nike support they told me that my shoes got lost from the transit and I felt like they don't have to tell me my shoes got lost it would be better if they tell me that my shoes was stole by their employees or shipping company because it is not possible if my shoes is going fall out of the car. I alway see my order status and it makes me feels bad and sad.Nike should care more customers.This is my first time with nike and I don't feel really good with that.Thanks,2022-08-11T01:16:37.000Z,Nike
"""Won"" a pair of purple jordan canyons…",Cheshire Cat,1,"""Won"" a pair of purple jordan canyons that I paid almost £180 for kiddos birthday (purchased from the SNKRS live event on 8/8/22, via the Nike SNKR app). Shoes arrived today, smelling of toxic plastic and came with a split in the plastic mesh on the front, that's been glued/repaired on one shoe! Essentially Nike sent these shoes knowing they were faulty !!! Been on Nike chat innumerable times, company don't give a damn.  kiddo is distraught with prospect of returning shoes, and Nike REFUSE to send a replacement for the faulty shoes they sent out, when they're back in stock at the end of August. What happened to customer service, or getting what you pay for? (I didn't agree to buy a pair of seconds!). Will never buy from this company again.

Defective or potentially fake boot…,Matthew Sproston,1,"Defective or potentially fake boot delivered Order no. C00958988548 I ordered the boots on the 2nd of August, they arrived today 4th of August. I opened the box and saw one boot differs to the other. One boot appears to be as advertised. The other looks like a fake logo font differing, finish quality poor, ventilation holes different sizes to the 'real looking' boot, stitching irregularities & errors as well as trim around the heel peeling away. The lettering looks like an arts and crafts accident. Messaged customer services team, they offered an exchange however their system has gone down, they said an email would follow and shut the chat down. No idea when I will be able to change these for a pair presented as advertised and expected from Nike. More alarming is I offered to send pictures of the boots in showing comparisons for them to investigate however they didn't seem interested, no doubt when the boots are returned they will find their way back into stock again. Very concerned I will now be stuck with a product not fit for purpose and £100+ lighter.",2022-08-04T18:23:49.000Z,Nike

No apology or anything.2nd order has disappeared after being way over delivery date and scanned several times in warehouse every day for over a week for some reason. Again no proper apology. Luckily items still in stock (or hope they are as were on offer) but who knows if will be by time they resend them out or if I’ll get them. They’re all fake cheery but don’t feel they really care or are bothered. They say one thing then days later find out isn’t the case. Feel very reluctant to ever order again as each time has been an issue. I wouldn’t recommend. Also takes it ages for items to be sent out for some reason and nothing arrives when should, plus items show as in stock when order but by time they’re dispatched it seems they aren’t. Maybe other customers after me get the items, who knows.

Incredibly disappointed,Isaac,1,"I want to express again how incredibly unhappy I am that I decided to purchase a product on Nike’s website. The product was shipped, UPS said they couldn’t find the address (which makes no sense as they had delivered one product from the same purchase no problem), eventually the product was marked as “receiver refused delivery” (which was not true as they never came to our door) and returned to their warehouse. When I contacted them I was told to repurchase the product and that I would get a refund for it. When I went to the website the product was no longer there, so I was told I would receive a refund for my previous purchase. I asked whether they could not just send me back the product that had clearly arrived at their warehouse and was told that wasn’t possible. I purchased the item 2 months ago and was told I would get a refund 3 weeks ago. The refund has come through, but I’m still disappointed at the way the whole situation was dealt with.Their customer service is just disgraceful! I can’t even express how stressful this has all been and making an online purchase with such a well known company should never be this stressful. Unsatisfied does not even begin to express what I’m feeling. Incredibly disappointed that Nike does not care about how their customers are treated.",2022-07-24T14:09:21.000Z,Nike

When I contacted them to explain my personal circumstances and my disability’s impact by the failure of a pair of shoes purchased in April 2022 and now unwearable, Nike staff member failed to grasp the urgent need for me to replace my faulty shoes. I’ve been unable to go outside for six days because of your incompetence. 5.Their dispatch process cannot be interrupted once an order has been submitted by a customer. Why not? If the status is ‘order sent to warehouse’ then a human intervention should at least be possible.6.Eventual delivery of new ordered shoes marred by unsealed packaging. What wasn’t in the box that should’ve been there? I have no idea! No info found on Nike website for providing  feedback or seeking post-delivery assistance. Clearly Nike not interested in customers’ experience of its delivery arrangements with Evri. Why did they switch from excellent DPD? Given all the above, not a fine experience.

Recently placed order,Matt rockwood,1,Recently placed order.  Item never arrived.  Nike said needed to wait 3 days past delivery date on item that was said to be delivered .  After 3 days told their shipping said it was not delivered even though what I received said it was.  Told item was refused and shipped back.  Not the case .  We have surveillance system to verify item never attempted to be delivered.  Item was birthday gift.  I understand mistakes happen.  Then was told that instead of sending back to me when received I could no longer get item.  That makes no sense.

Becoming more bothered about taking…,Pac Mac,1,Becoming more bothered about taking peoples money than providing quality products. Received some Cortez sp trainers. They look good in the pictures (as always😂) but when I opened them up they are so badly made. Who makes these trainers some poor Vietnamese people that you probably pay £10 a year. Maybe if you gave them a pay rise they would start to produce better quality footwear. What’s with the new design tongues on the Cortez the airmax 90 running club the furyosa what an earth is this dodgy cheap material you are now using. Every pair of trainers I receive with this material as the tongue is always frayed. What a joke. Dunlop and gola trainers have better materials than Nike. I can’t send them back because they have sold out everywhere!!!!!  Thanks again Nike for selling me a pair of poorly made trainers. I thought you have quality inspection??  Change your Moto to NIKE DONT DO IT if I was you. You are conning people out of hard earned money!! My 5 year old son could make better footwear than your people. Get a grip and sort your materials out. Absolutely disgusting. Been wearing nike since the 1980.s but not no more. I feel I’ve been conned. If you want I’ll upload pictures of about 10 Nike trainers that are brand new boxed and show how poorly made they are. Fix up,2022-07-16T16:54:43.000Z,Nike

They were sent on 7/6/22, well over a month ago. Despite many frustrating phone calls and empty promises for a manager to call me within 24 or 48 hrs, I am ignored and receive no calls. I have just ended yet another call as the promised call was yet again not received yesterday, only to be told it has been escalated again and a manager will call within 48hrs.We are a sports mad family but I will never buy another Nike product.

Very poor customer service,Clare Smith,1,"Very poor customer service, had some IDs stolen in delivery. Was given a refund then locked out my account and can't re order. First I spoke to Francess he incompetence was visible as had written no noted from the call, Maria picked up. Then she had put notes on for Nikolay. They would rather lose a customer than  sort out the issue with theft which had been slapped all over the news about the products being stolen by postmen. I expect I'm going to be purchasing from footlocker if not sorted today as Maria stated on a recorded call. I will be retrieving these and posting transcripts. About time nike took accountability to their member or why have a subscription for members. Seems like a total lack of customers service or the need to want to help. No some fool rocking around with my sons name on the back of the shoe. Nike also stop putting your branding on the outside of packages asking dor trouble. And us customers are at a loss. Very unhappy and will be making complaints about all listed",2022-07-11T10:20:48.000Z,Nike

From the second she answered the call, she was a problem-solver and sweetheart!  She understood my stress at a football mama.  She found solutions for us and did it all with professionalism, kindness, compassion, and joy!  Where do we find that these days?  I will always order from Nike.com after this experience.

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!,Marilyn Thomas,1,"If I could leave no stars, then I would. The Canadian Nike customer service REPS (plural, had to call back multiple times) were absolutely incompetent. Nike obviously outsources to Asia because I had to rephrase, repeat, rephrase, repeat. I taught English in Japan for two years, so I have a good ear for deciphering poor English, but this was a hopeless situation. Bottom line.....if you need to contact customer service in Canada, be prepared for erroneous information, apathetic representatives and an overall frustrating experience. Repeated requests to speak to a supervisor were declined as no one was supposedly available. Also, I kept getting cut off, probably because of the connection to the Phillipines. No more Nikes for me. I am on a mission to share my horrible experiences as it appears Nike couldn't care less. Keep the jobs in Canada where they belong so people don't need an interpreter. With the prices you charge, I'd expect my representative to speak fluent English.",2022-07-07T01:14:41.000Z,Nike

These new pants are terrible, they have faded to the point of being unrecognizable. The pants he got 10 years ago have faded better than these new ones. My dad called to ask about the policy and the guy he talked to directed him to corporate. Corporate was closed, it was a Sunday. When he finally got to talk with corporate we were told to pay to have them mailed into headquarters and they would decide whether or not the pants were not up to quality. Even though we wouldn't have called if they were 'nike quality'. The policies are ridiculous and it seems absurd that you would do this being a billion dollar company.",2022-07-03T20:22:13.000Z,Nike

I Didn't receive any refund, so sometime in May I contacted Nike and was told that I didn't confirm whether or not I wanted the refund, and that I didn't give them my mailing adress, even though my return adress was on the box that I sent the sneakers in. I still didn't get any refund, so I contacted Nike again, and was told that they don't know what happened, but that the refund for $95 is in the mail and that if I don't get it by the end of June I should contact them. I contacted them on the 28th of June and was told by a customer service representative that no refund was mailed out to me, which the representative told me was in the mail in early June.

Appalling Customer Service!!,Martin McNulty,1,"I’ve been a loyal Nike.com customer for years and never had any problems with customer service, that is until the start of 2022. I had to chase up 2 refunds earlier this year and had to provide proof of postage on both occasions- never had to do this before, but I got the refunds. In December I bought 6 pairs of running shoes, 3x size 8.5 and 3x size 9 at a cost of £599.82, the 8.5’s were a bit too small so I returned these for a refund of £299.91 which I received shortly after. One of the size 9’s had 2 small holes in the front of the right shoe so I returned these for a replacement. I then started to wear the first pair when I was out running, these only lasted for around 50 miles so I contacted Nike and they told me to send all 3 pairs back. I did this on 20th April, they received them back on 23rd April as I obtained a proof of delivery from the Post Office. Since then I have been on phone calls, live chats and emails for hours upon hours trying to get this further refund of £299.91. On 25th May I was sent an email confirming that my return had been received and they had refunded my £299.91 back to my credit card, they said it would take between 5-9 days for the refund to process. 9 days later no refund. Long story short, I have received an email today saying they haven’t received my return, despite me sending them the proof of postage and proof of delivery. So either the shoes have went missing, or they’re calling me a liar. 64 days after I returned the order I’m no further forward and have no faith whatsoever that I’ll ever see this money back. I’ve genuinely never had such appalling customer service and if I could give them no stars I would. Until I get my refund I’m going to continuously troll them on social media until I get my money back. I doubt very much that I’ll ever use Nike.com again",2022-06-23T21:30:50.000Z,Nike

I came home and ordered online, waited three weeks, and the shoes didn’t come in. I called Nike, and the shoes had been lost in a warehouse by FedEx, so Nike issued a return and re-ordered the same shoes. I waited another week and saw that the shipment hadn’t started, so I called Nike once more and was told the rep I spoke with last time ordered incorrectly in the system, so the shoes never went out. I asked to order a third time, but the shoes were now entirely out of stock. I was issued a refund but not told it would take 7 to 10 days to clear, so I had to wait to order my final pair of shoes.

Just don't do it !!!,P n,1,Ordered some socks to my work place. EVRI driver delivered at 7:43pm and we closed at 7pm. Driver left parcel outside and took a picture of it as expected it was stolen. Raised this with Nike customer service after waiting two weeks and making several calls I was advised that I would not be receiving a refund as they dispatched the item correctly and therefore are not liable. I challenged this and was then told that I had not provided a valid address. The address provided was a business address that I get all parcels sent to if we are closed come back the next day ? Luckily I paid using Paypal who have now issued me a full refund. The customer service for this company is a joke and I will not be purchasing from them again.,2022-05-27T16:28:52.000Z,Nike

Then 6.5 came into stock anyway, so I returned, for an exchange, only to find out the shoes went back up to full price and if I wanted another pair I would need to pay the (£100) extra.

I wanted to make a complaint about a random raffle they had on 28/4/22 for a pair Nike Dunk low SB Habanero Red (Bart Simpson shoes) I was blocked as well as lots of other people from entering this Random raffle for the shoes.The Best part of this complaint is that Nike had informed me that i did not select the item in the raffle not that they call it that, they call “ the draw “ it’s supposed to be a random draw which it's not.A lot of people ware blocked from entering the draw were bing blocked by blocking software it’s quite easy to do via a VPN+onionIf someone from NIKE just happens to look at this PLEASE have a look on EBAY and you will see hundreds of shoes all being sold by the same person using a different IP of course. He will add in different shoes sizes into the mix of course There is some genuine sellers there but majority of them are being sold by the same person. NIKE have assured there customers that there is software in place to stop people buying multiple orders. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT WORKING NIKE !!!? You could have stop this from happening by reducing the time of draw to 5 minutes as 15 minutes is a long time you can do a lot of damage in that time.This is so unfair to most of us honest members and on your 50th anniversary as well, so unfair.There is only one way you can pay them back is General release of the shoe that will hurt him.

Known fault with Nike 720! Zero customer service,Stephen Keen,1,Purchased a pair of Nike 720 in March 2020. Noticed that the left trainer sole is deflated. Looked online and discovered this is a known fault with this trainer. Contacted Nike who parroted the ‘2 year warranty mantra’ they couldn’t care less or take into account for a year of that time we were in lockdown. So I now have a pair of trainers with very little wear that cost £154 that are useless! And because I am slightly out of the warranty Nike literally just flip you the finger when you contact them.

ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING - AVOID NIKE PRODUCTS!,Mandy,1,"Purchased a pair of 'WHITE' Nike Max 95 at a cost of £150 for my Son. Wore them 6-7 times & the white LEATHER (prob plastic), turned creamy yellow after my Son wore them out in the rain - do not see any info stating only to be worn in dry weather?? I would probably understand if the Canvas part of the Trainers discoloured, but for the Leather to turn a creamy yellow is quite strange.  I have called Nike today & the advisor 'Eroco' informed me that the same thing happened to him when he wore a pair (not exactly the best recommendation for the Company who pay him his salary). He advised that I send them back at my own expense - as if the £150 I paid for the 'Horrific Quality' Trainers isnt enough of a payment. In my position in Consumer Resolution, I will be following this up and gathering all the reviews posted, so please continue to post your personal experience - both good & bad.

I am a collector and  to me this de values my purchase not having the correct box. They asked me for pictures and then proceed to tell me they cant send me a box.

Arrogant Customer Service,Steve Carter,1,Received faulty pair of socks with hole in.

Lack of Communication,Terri Robinson,1,"Wow.  Very surprised to see that Nike had such low reviews.  I placed an order on April 1, 2022, received an email confirmation for the order the same day.  On April 3, 2022, I received another email stating that my order hadn't shipped yet but was still on schedule.  On schedule, NOT!!!  I called on April 8, 2022 to inquire about the order and was informed that the order cancelled just this morning.  What the heck...No notification of cancellation was received.  Unsatisfactory on ALL levels.  Well guess what, they charged me when the order was placed but I must wait 3-4 days for reimbursement.  Disappointed in NIKE to say the least.  Next time, I'll read the reviews first, shame on me for not reading the reviews.  Lesson well taught!",2022-04-08T13:43:12.000Z,Nike

How can you allow an item to be snatched away from you when you are on the payment steps?! That's completely outrageous! Customer service agent was completely unhelpful telling me that they can't refund the gift voucher and that I could be on the lookout for more stock (no sh@t!) or spend it elsewhere on the site! I explained that I was not looking at wasting £83 anywhere on their useless site but I wanted just that specific item.

The worst,Pheonix Marketing LTD.,1,"The worst. Myself and my partner have both been loyal nike customers for years … and after the last year we are both left stunned at the appalling quality nike clothes holds as well as their shoe size availability and overall lack of supply. My partner is an XL In both tops and bottoms, of any brand, not just Nike. He has been struggling with the few recent styles of tracksuits because although the XL clothes seem to be getting wider, the arm lengths seem to be getting shorter. Honestly, he looks like a buffoon most times when trying his new Nike clothes on. The amount of times we went based off trust and grabbed his size off the shelves to only be getting home and feeling disappointed. On top of it all, their quality check on clothes is appalling. Endless loose threads, wonky tags and an overall disappointing finish to what’s meant to be a brand that ‘performers’ use. To top it all off, his latest pair of Nike joggers had NO STRING INSIDE ??? Seems to me they care more about pocketing money, increased profit margins and are heavily affecting their image doing so. How much longer do they think they can literally mug us all off? I have a large social media following I’m going to be sure to post this up and expect a Nike reply from it. Lol.

Really Nike?,Steven Upshaw,2,"I recently bought a pair of trainers whilst I was in the USA using the USA Nike website. I've come back to the UK noticing that the quality is not up to standard. When I buy an expensive shoe from Nike, I expect the quality to be top-notch if I plan on having them for at least two years.I've come back and contacted Nike UK customer services asking if I can get these sent to a hub in the UK for an exchange/replacement and they've said no. They've told me I cannot initiate a return online and that I have to take it to a Nike Store for them to be looked at.My nearest open Nike Store is 70km away.I'm really unhappy with this service.

Don't order customs,Holly,1,"I ordered some custom Dunks in January 2022 and never got them. When I got in contact with Nike CS in February to chase the order I was told they had been delivered to a Go Outdoors. I wasn't told about this, I was never contacted. So when I was told about the store, I went to collect the shoes, but they weren't there. So I tried to contact the person I had spoke to at Nike, she finally got back in touch and said I must have missed the cut off point (however I would have been within the 10 days if the dates she told me were correct). I was told to be patient as they were going back to them, and an investigation would open and they would be sent back out to me. I wait till March, sending 3 emails to ask for an update, to which I got no reply. I went back to Nike CS and had to re-explain the situation, all I am offered is a full refund to re-order them or to continue to wait. So I said will it be more than a month again as I am moving, I was told probably not. So I agree to wait. End of March comes around, no contact from anyone, no sign of the shoes so I had to get back in contact and ask again, re-explain to a third person and get told the same thing, still 'under investigation' and all they can offer is a refund to re-order. I even said if you can give me the refund and a discount I would accept that, they wouldn't even do that. So after waiting months, I have finally requested a full refund. What a waste of time. Hopefully the money comes back into my account with no problems because I can't go through is a third time. Waste of time, money and stress.",2022-03-30T14:37:56.000Z,Nike

"Rude Staff, Supervisor Refuses to Speak to you and Parcels Stolen",David Bewers,1,"I ordered 2 pairs of Trainers from Nike who uses Hermes (Now Evri) as their Courier. The parcel has gone 'missing' with the Courier which translates to it's been stolen (this is not the first time I have had this happen with this courier). I tried contacting Hermes about this but they do not answer their phones, ever. I did find one phone number that charged me £6.67 for a 10 second phone call where I didn;t manage to speak to anyone.I have tried speaking to Nike on 2 separate occasions, both times they were not prepared to assist me - on my second attempt I asked to speak to a manager. The person I was speaking to said he has to make a request for me to speak with a manager who will then call me back in 1-3 days, but my request was immediately denied. I asked him to request this again and apparently it was denied again.The situation to date is I have paid £250 ish for 2 pairs of trainers plus a £6.67 phone call, I have made countless phone calls to Nike, I have tried online chats and other means of contact with Hermes (Now Evri) all of which have got me absolutely no where.Nike are refusing to refund me my money until Hermes have 'concluded their investigation' - an investigation that Hermes/Evri have completely ignored.For such an enormous multi billion pound company it astounds me that they can provide such an awful service.I could never understand why companies use Hermes/Evri as their courier because they are complete crooks but now it makes sense - the companies like Nike use Hermes/Evri because they don't care about their customers.Shame on you Nike.",2022-03-28T11:12:30.000Z,Nike

I processed a refund after my order was left in a pickup location (if the order had have come when they advised someone would have been in) to which accessing the box was impossible as I was told to scan a qr code, but there was no scanner on the machine. So I let it get sent back, I then had to message them off my own back to start the refund even though they had received it. The person who “dealt“ with the refund said it would take up to 10 working days. A joke. But still I waited and did. Not receive my refund on the 10th day because the person who processed it forgot to do it. I then had to message again to chase and was then told another wait for up to 9 days. A joke. After chasing again the next day the ‘customer service’ representative said she asked them to do it quicker. This should have been done anyway after their error. Then was belittled and had my questions constantly avoided by the unhelpful staff team.

Exceptionally Poor Online Ordering Experience,MB,1,"If there were negative stars that is what I would select. I was placing an online order when the site told me it could not be placed because it ´timed out’. So I sent the order again. About 30-40 minutes later I received two emails about two minutes apart showing two orders of the same item. I called customer service and was cut off 5 times. When I made it through I was told they cannot cancel the order because it was greater than 30 minutes after the order was placed. Where do they tell you this?  On the website when you attempt to cancel an order and certainly not when you are placing it! Fast forward 2 days and the order has not shipped which is totally fine. What is not fine is that you cannot cancel an order that has not shipped. I could probably return a half eaten chicken to Costco for goodness sakes. On the Canadian site I find terms of service saying you can cancel an order any time before it is shipped. So I call customer service again and got the same representative and supervisor I spoke with 2 days prior. After being back and forth on hold for 30 minutes they tell me those are the terms of service only if you are ordering from China! I ask to speak with someone higher and the supervisor tells me they don’t provide anyone higher. So, while consumers are all helping Phil Knight get a few more billion in his bank account, Nike is leaving 2 people (who are probably not paid what their experience is worth) to deal with an exceptionally poor cancellation policy without any further recourse. Nike will spend more time/money/carbon to ship the duplicate item only to have me return it (unless there is some fine print I missed there) than to simply cancel what is clearly a duplicate order that has not even shipped. The fact that a multi-billion dollar company cannot afford to have a better customer care process/experience in place baffles me. The company can and should do better. Given the many other negative reviews posted, it seems for Nike the service motto should be the customer is never right.",2022-03-07T23:40:22.000Z,Nike

Got denied buying items in store,Marco k,1,"I went to the store in Utrecht Hoog Catharijne and saw some Nike dunk retro panda’s that i wanted to purchase for either me (size 43)or my girl (size 39-40). These shoes are hard to come by so i was willing to take a bargain on the size 40,5 that they had in the store. You would think that this would be an easy purchase. I can tell/assure you that it was the contrary. The staff told me that i could not buy this shoe because that was not my size and if my girlfriend wanted them she had to come and buy them herself. I was speaking to S and N ( who implied she was the manager, but honestly if that was the manager you might be better of appointing a third grader and he/she might even be better at communicating politely)  and they told me that it is Nike’s policy and they cannot sell the shoes to me. I was flabbergasted at best. So in other words my girlfriend has to take a day off to buy her own shoes or she has to pay resell in the range of 250€ or more. I am very disappointed in how Nike handled it also when i called the customer service to help me with this issue.

Wouldn’t order any trainers,Luke Regan,1,"Wouldn’t order online. I have been buying Nike trainers for years, as the years go on the products seem to go up in price and the quality drops massively. Just this week alone I’ve had to return two pairs of trainers, one pair which looked like they’d been glued by someone with their eyes closed and another pair where the paint looks like it’s been done in the dark. Bare in mind these aren’t cheap Nike trainers either, one pair costing £180 and another £135. Clearly Nike have no quality control department.",2022-02-26T13:00:37.000Z,Nike

Absolutely terrible customer care,Josh Fritts,1,"Absolutely terrible customer care. The representatives are polite and kind on the phone, but actual product support policy is terrible. Spent $90 on a pair of Flex RN runners and just over a year later both shoes had worn holes through on the TOP side over the toes. Shoes supposedly have a 2 year warranty period for defects. It doesn’t get much more obvious than this as far as defects. However, they denied my claim and stated it was normal wear and tear. What a joke.

Worst experience ever!!!!,Charbel Younan,1,"Worst experience ever!!!!! I was waiting for a birthday gift that my girlfriend bought from Nike which was arriving on the 5th of Jan. On the 4th of Jan she got a message from Hermes saying that an issue has occurred and to give them 1 day to fix it. 2 days later same issue so she went and used Nike customer chat support, they told her it will be fixed in 1-2 business days. 1 week later still no reply, I took over and chatted with customer support they said the same thing 1-2 days and it will arrive. After waiting 5 days, today I contacted them again and apparently, the shoes got lost, and the only offer they gave is for it to be reshipped. I asked for any type of compensation, esp since we didn't get any notice that it was lost and the first 2 contacts were horrible. The only thing offered was a 10% compensation for a future purchase. So my birthday gift never came, they never notified us that it was lost, after contacting them twice as well they didn't notify us that it was lost.

"poor,terrible chat customer service",Wingdone Oni,1,Initially contacted them because their order sytem kept putting me in a loop and unable to complete the order even though i had authorizations on my account. chat agents kept asking me to take screenshot of my account which i cannot possibly do because of the bank's security policy which physically doesnt let you do that. managed to take a picture from.another screen but the idiot i spoke to said it wasn't from them and ended the chat. I already explained i was using 3rd party payment system which is an option on their website ie paypal so it shows paypal instead. i phoned instead and spoke to this lovely lady who understood right away. but the chat agents were like talking to a brick wall. i don't get it. im sure they would have been trained about 3rd party payment. why put that as an option if the agents know nothing about it. i just needed confirmation that it's not a charge. 😑,2022-01-11T13:33:50.000Z,Nike
Lesson learned,Vai Via,1,Lesson learned: Don’t purchase online if you’re not 100% sure of your size or else the refund process will take a month or 2!

"Nike cancelled order after two weeks, they didn't ""Just Do It""",dom,1,"Was bombarded everyday with emails to visit online store with discount code. Discount code didn't work on sale items but I did find a pair of trainers I liked so purchased. Waited over two weeks and then just received an email from Nike saying the order was cancelled. Spoke to customer services who just said that they always work on improving the experience or something generic like that. No offer of replacement at same price etc. The trainers are now back at full price (albeit not in my size). Absolute garbage to take an order and then take two weeks to cancel it. Good job it wasn't a present. When they say ""Just Do It"" I expect just that! Recommend sticking to other sports outlets.",2022-01-10T14:10:14.000Z,Nike
Bad service and cannot replace order,Ellie,1,Nike have recently had a sale where they had some vapormax 50% off. I ordered a pair on the 30th December and got told they had been dispatched however I never received them and after looking into the matter I was told that they had been lost in transit which Nike did not update me to let me know. When I asked to have them resent as I got a £199 pair of vapormax for £89 they told me that they were out of stock so I requested if I could just choose the same pair in a different colour that was in stock but they refused and said they will just give me 15% code or I could choose another pair of trainers in a lower price bracket meaning that I could not get vapormax. Therefore I thought I was getting a really good deal with Nike but clearly not. I am disgusted with the service as I am usually a Nike customer and I am just shocked that all they could seem to offer me was a pair already on sale in a colour that isn't very nice and 15% code. I am not sure I will be shopping with them again as they can not guarantee you will get your order if it is on offer. Not happy.,2022-01-10T12:29:10.000Z,Nike

Shambolic - Order ref: C00726499332,Joe Brown,1,"I ordered my nephews a £50 Nike gift voucher each for Christmas via the official Nike.com site on 21 December, for delivery to my address as we were having our family Christmas gathering on 2 January. I get that it was close to Christmas, but estimated delivery was 30 December so no problem I thought. By 31 December the order status was still 'preparing package' so I used the chat function... the person on the other end made the right noises about investigating but nobody got back to me. I tried the chat function again on January 2 - again, the right noises were being made but no actual action... I said it was pointless sending to me now and requested the address be changed to theirs, as I'd only be posting them again when they eventually arrived. They said no problem, note added to change the address. It gets to yesterday - 5 January - status still 'package being prepared' so I get onto the chat function for a third time to find out what is going on... it's just two vouchers and it had by then been two weeks wait with no information. Again, apologetic, and they said all they could suggest was to cancel and refund so I said fine, do that. Imagine my surprise when late last night - six hours after they agreed to cancel the order - I receive an email saying they'd been dispatched. They arrived today, wonderful, but to add insult to injury they arrived here and weren't sent to my nephews as agreed so I now have to pay for postage additionally. It's been a comedy of errors and zero information, I will be pursuing them for my postage costs as a point of principle.",2022-01-06T23:58:07.000Z,Nike

Never received my order,Aida Allan,1,"I have always ordered from Nike in the past. Order was always on time with no issues.  I placed my order however I still haven’t received anything. I contacted customer services through Chat. They said that the carrier hasn’t picked it up and my delivery would be on its way soon. I contacted them after waiting 3 weeks, now they tell me my only option was a refund because it was never delivered and my shoes were out of stock. I’m still bummed because I’ve been a Nike member for years. Reading most of the reviews on here and it seems to me that they don’t have anything in-stock.",2021-12-19T05:50:57.000Z,Nike

Truly Horrible Shopping Experience & Very Bad Customer Service,Noni Fayyaz,1,"Very bad customer service. My order was delayed by several weeks after Nike shipped it using a courier company named LSO. LSO did not show any tracking information for it. After spending a lot of time on chat, I was able to cancel it. The item arrived almost a month late and I had to make 1 chat and 1 call to figure out how to return it. Nike said that they could not have UPS pick the order up and I would have to drop it off at a UPS store. Then they could not figure out a way to send a return label since the order had been cancelled. So they told me to wait for a few days to receive the return label. The agents were unhelpful. A lot of time wasted.",2021-12-17T20:23:24.000Z,Nike
Terrible customer service,Maria Calderone,1,Terrible customer service. Placed an order and wanted to cancel it within an hour but they told me their policy was within 30 mins.

Terrible customer service,Sarah,1,"I had bought a pair of shoes from Nike. When they were delivered I noticed black marks on the shoe that did not rub off and were more like stains. My sister had dealt with Nike customer services before and was really happy as her item was lost on the post, they offered her a full refund plus a 50% promotion code to use on their site. I spoke to customer services in live chat. After sending photos etc I was told there were no shoes in that size left in stock so the only option was a refund. I explained my frustration as if the shoes were quality checked before leaving the warehouse I would not be in this situation and also the shoe is sold out on all other sites including Nike .I was only offered a 20% compensation which I was not happy with .  I went onto say I felt a larger compensation should be given so I can use it to get the shoes professionally cleaned as if I sent the shoes back I would not be able to find another pair before Christmas. The highest discount they could offer me was 20% and there was no real empathy to the situation. After the situation still not being resolved I asked to speak to a manager. Once a manger emailed me they explained the phone lines were not working so it had to be dealt with over email. I explained the situation and the fact they were for a Christmas present . A manger replied and explained there was a custom site where the shoe was similar in style but more expensive. I was given a 20% discount code to bring the shoe down to the original shoes price which is £99. I replied saying I was offered 20% off the originally £99 on the live chat. So with the 20% off the more expensive shoe I would actually be receiving no compensation for the troubles that have been caused. After once again no empathy for the situation or any more support we chose to go with the more expensive shoe just so I would have a Christmas present. The manager then proceeded to tell me that the more expensive shoes take 5-6 weeks to arrive. I was really upset at this point as I stated that They are for a Christmas present and why were they given as an option when they would clearly not be here. The reply I got was once going unipersonal and scripted. The only response I was getting was the best situation would be for you to return the shoe. I was explaining that it is not an option. If I return these shoes I will not be able to get another pair in time for Christmas. The only option is a higher discount to compensate for me having to get them professionally cleaned. I also reiterated that once again this is not our error it was theirs and I would not be in this situation if checks would of been taken. All I felt is I was not being listen to and almost being blamed for the error like it is my problem. I was also frustrated as I know higher discount could be given out but they chose not too. When I replied with the above I was told that 20% discount of the original shoe price was all they could offer and they would now close the case. We took the 20% compensation as we knew it was about to be closed even though our issue wasn’t resolved but £18 to get shoes professionally cleaned does not even cover it. The £18 we received back won’t even cover a clean and also means we received no compensation from the company for all the above. I’ve been with other shoe company’s where say a small area is marked and they offer 60% back as they would be unable to to re sell them such as ego. For a big company for it to be so impersonal I would not buy directly again. Even a gesture of a compensation plus a cleaning kit for the shoe to be sent out would of been more helpful.",2021-12-14T21:55:44.000Z,Nike

defective product,April,1,I purchased a pair of nike gsb airmax 270 for my 7yr old for the price of 120 including tax 130 due to the need of  needing a new pair of shoes. Day 2 of having the shoe I noticed the front rubber was coming loose from the shoe. I tried to exchange the shoe from the foot locker that I had purchased it from but they tell me that I have to file a claim. So that's what I tried to do. But my son would be shoeless because during this process they have to get the shoe and inspect it. I'm like totally upset now I'll just take the darn shoe to a shoe repair store and get it fixed! I spent way to much money for this problem to occur and the process of getting a exchange! this policy sucks!!!! never again will I buy a expensive a** shoe again! this one shoe is a price of two if you ask me for a kid anyway...,2021-12-13T20:12:04.000Z,Nike

Days go by and no 20% percent refund, Which leads me to ring them today to be told that they cannot give me the 20% as promised because I had already been given a 10% code from the first pair of trainers that I didn't get, a code that I didn't want need or use.

I was then told there was a tech issue in Nike warehouse. Laughable considering it was dispatched ages ago and ups are saying they have it somewhere but now can’t find it so either it wasn’t ever sent to ups and all the updates are a lie or it was sent and ups lost item. I asked for a refund and was told will take 48 hrs to see if I can get a refund 🙄 then was told I might not even get a refund.

Two Year Warranty On Nike Trainers Is A Joke.,Trae Browne,1,"I also had a pair of Nike Trainers again an air bubble popped so I contacted Nike, and got a very expensive £13 returns label emailed to me to post to Amsterdam when I live in the UK. Six weeks later and online chat after chat, and still no credit on the account for these faulty trainers claim, or return postage to Holland so I phoned and this latest guy even lied over the phone. Again wanted me to reply to one of his emails with proof of postage and said that I would have the refund today, then at the end of the call used the usual it will be escaled to management blah blah blah. Then he said that he never said that I would have the refund today, so I played him a recording of our phone call while his lying you know what was still on the line. Of course he decided to release the call after he actually thought that I was a liar, and didn't have a recording of his lying you know what. Anyway I'll give these lying lot until Friday, and then I'll just go through the small claims court to get my money back.

After 7 weeks I started enquiring with customer services about this and was given no real answer, just an email to say sorry for the delay. Another 2 weeks down the line I tried again, this time with confirmation of issues with their factory. I was paired with a person from customer services, who emailed me at least 3 times a week, the vast majority of the time with a duplicate email of the previous and no further information. 100 days after purchase, I was finally told I would receive some compensation for my issues, but no confirmation of what that would be. When the shoes did arrive (almost 5 months later), they were clearly around 3 shoes sizes too big and had to be returned. The compensation I received was an out-of-date 20% discount code.

Nike.com Shipping a Disaster,Dillon Davis,1,"I've always enjoyed Nike products but ordered directly from their website for the first time last week. When my order shipped, I saw that it was going to be delivered by LaserShip. Having never heard of LaserShip, I had to do a quick Google search and oh boy, that raised the alarms. Countless awful--not bad, AWFUL-- reviews after customers had packages arrive weeks late, sometimes damaged, or for many of them, never received the package at all. Sure enough, my package was marked as ""out for delivery"" this morning at 9:30am. At 9:45pm this evening, I was informed the package was left at my door 10 minutes ago. There was nothing there, and I also have a Ring on my door, so it's an utter lie to say it was delivered. My options by a Nike customer service rep were to either issue a refund or receive half of my order because the other item is no longer available. No ""Hey, sorry about that, let us make this right"" or anything. Just a ""Let's roll the dice with LaserShip one more time or here's your money back.""

Appallingly bad telephone customer service,Anthony,1,"Unlike Adidas' website there is no automatic exchange facility if you want to exchange for another size.  You have to call Nike customer service, who seem slow and unsure about everything.  I called to request to return a size 7.5 and exchange it for size 7.  The lady seemed hesitatant and not very reassuring but she assured me a size 7 would be sent once the 7.5's had been received.  Today I had notification that the purchase price had been refunded to my card - no exchange!  To reorder a 7.5 would mean paying £60 more online as the price has shot up.  A further frustrating phone call to another uncertain lady told me the only way to resolve it was to reorder the 7.5 and pay the higher price.  And then once I received shipping notification to call again and ask the agent for a 25% discount!  I don't feel at all confident that would happen, given recent experiences!  She couldn't send me an email to confirm this arrangement, nor transfer me to a supervisor.  Really, really rubbish customer service with people who have no authority to help constructively.

The vapors were purchased at beaverton pro store at their plant the 2018 were purchased at the local outlet store. Within less that 3 weeks both right bladders deflated. I tried bringing them the the pro store , but just being a US Marine wasn't enough to get back in even though I showed their security I purchased them there. The answer I receiver was I don't have an ambassador not so ""get off the campus before I get arrested"" what a way to treat a military veteran.  I went to the outlet store with no help there either. I was told the manager was not on the premises and she would be the only one to be able to do this credit. I was asked to leave the shoes there and the manager would call me before 3 the next day. We'll that came and went I returned the following day and the manager was there and called me a liar stating her assistant manager I was to call before three. Needless to say I pulled my phone out and let her hear and watch the whole conversation.  I had the phone in my shirt pocket capturing the whole play by play lies they tried to push on me. The manager without any apology stated she sent them to corporate and it was on her. I called dozens of times and got the run around. Finally I get orders to go back to the middle east and call nike to let them know I would like and answer or resolution when I return in 6-10 months. I return with no return contact from Nike. No phone call , no e-mail and not mail. I call nike and I was told due to my lack of contact they didn't think I wanted to go any further. So nike let it go. I was then disconnected.  I called and I received an man and told him my story for about the 15th time and he said it will stop today. He stated he would credit me a nike gift card for the product the nike clearly dropped the ball on. And a 15% of the next purchase.  Well that didn't show. What did show was some fake/made up story about 3 shoes and there prices and the gave me have of what I paid. All three of the shoes they stated were less than half of what they sell in their stores. I want the credit for the two pair of shoes that I purchased for over 500$ and had them all of three three weeks and were taken from me with the understanding I would get a credit for the defective shoes.

Terrible Customer Service,Saffii Phillips,1,"Placed an order online for NikeID at the end of September for a Christmas present. I understand that these orders take a number of weeks to be produced and shipped, however I received an email on the 2nd November to tell me that the order had been shipped. I have been tracking this and there has been no update on the shipping since the 9th November. All the tracking says is that there is a delay and my order is in Germany. I have contacted Nike customer services to try to get an update, but the only response I get is 'As far as we can see the order is shipped, you need to contact the courier yourself'. I have contacted the courier, but had no response and there still isn't an update on when my order will be delivered.I work in sales and customer service myself and I completely understand that due to Covid and Brexit there have been numerous delays on shipping, however I would appreciate it if the company I purchased my order from would be more willing to help chase the order, as I fear this will get lost with the lead up to Christmas and there being a lot more parcels in the system. I ordered this back in September to try to avoid the Christmas rush in the hope that I would receive the order in plently of time, but I fear that if this is lost and I need to reorder I won't receive the order until after Christmas as the website states the production time of these orders can be anything between 4 and 6 weeks.",2021-11-15T16:08:24.000Z,Nike

Bola did not replyI contacted Nike again on 1st September and was told by Jake'The correct teams have investigated your cases regarding the issues mentioned. Again on this occasion no refund will be issued to you and the decision has been made by senior staff and is final'. I asked who I could escalate my complaint to and was told by Jake 'this case is out of our hands, that's the senior teams decision and we don't have control to change their decision'.I then got the same response from Luiz, who spoke to his supervisor and again the decision is final but i could raise my complaint with an online dispute platform.I got the same response from Ellie on 3rd Nov however she went further and told me'Please note that the tee was not lost in the warehouse but simply not returned to us in the parcel' basically calling me a liar! (also Elie clearly hadn't checked as she kept referring to the Tee when I returned a long sleeve jumper!)I would advise all customers to avoid Nike online if you are not 100% certain your are keeping the item. As they have the right to claim you did not return an item, call you a liar and keep your money. If you question them, their senior team will decide it was not returned. The don't even have a sufficient level of customer service to contact you to tell you their decision you have to chase them. But as long as they get the money....***Update***I raised my complaint through the online complaint resolution that Nike said I had to use and not surprisingly 30 days later Nike didn’t even respond so the case was closed.

Now, it won't be delivered and I have to wait until they receive the return to get refunded for money I paid for products that didn't get to me BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOMPETENCE. I don't understand how a company who makes as much as they do off of oversea children doesn't invest in their service, but willingly give endorsements to athletes.

Use the app at own risk,Adam Lawes,1,"Their app is terrible. I placed an order, paying using PayPal. The money was allocated pending the order being processed by Nike but after checking in the app to see if my order registered, I was told that I hadn't placed any orders with Nike yet. After nearly an hour, I checked again. Still no order in my history and the $150 pending allocation. So I placed another order to try and use the $150 withdrawn from my PayPal account, only to find they withdrew another $150. I then called their ""customer service"" line to be told that only one order could be cancelled as the other was older than 30 minutes, the salt in the wound was that the refund would take up to 5 days to be credited. They're great at taking your $$$ but so damn slow to refund it. I'll never buy from Nike again. Arrogant attitude and crappy app technology.

The colours are great but the wear is just so mediocre. I will always love Nike but hate how faddy they’ve become. I literally have all the knit airs in my hallway to remind me how much I loved them, and they all lasted two plus years of love. Now Nikes have no structure and make your legs ache.

I have to call them again only to be told my parcel is missing (surprise!) and that they would send me an email regarding the refund. They could not resend the order as the items were out of stock.

I’m having the worst customer service…,Anna Blasco,1,I’m having the worst customer service experience with Nike Spain. On Aug 20 I returned and requested a change of size  of a pair of sneaker I had bought online. The new pair never arrived. I contacted numerous times customer services and each time I was told the warehouse was going to send the sneaker that week. Nothing arrived. After 6 weeks I was told by a customer service agent that it was better if I cancelled the order as the warehouse was never going to send the new pair. So I cancelled the order expecting the refund of that 97 euros I had already paid. 3 weeks later and the refund hasn’t arrived. I’ve already called 3 times customer service and each time I’m being told a different story. So it seems Nike has an issue with its order system and it appears there’s nothing pending to be refunded to me. So 9 weeks after I requested a change of size I have 97 euros less and no sneakers. Im hoping at some point this will be resolved but after this experience I’m not going to buy from Nike again.,2021-10-05T10:08:18.000Z,Nike

Called Nike back, they said they emailed the company in charge of delivery and haven’t received a response. I asked them to call the company. They blamed the pandemic for the delay in delivery.

Unbelievably poor service,Daniel Cliffe,1,"Unbelievably poor service. Ordered some custom Nike By You Air Force 1s on July 12th. Says it takes 2-3 weeks to deliver, 4 weeks passed and nothing. Contacted Nike and not one single person has any idea where they were, was just told they’ll be a delay and will contact me when they know anything. Another 2 weeks had passed to be told they will be delivered on 21st September! Like what the hell? That’s more than 2 months wait. I argued my case and asked for compensation which they offered me a measly 20% discount code (something you get as a member quite regularly). I contacted them a week or so after to confirm the order was still going to be delivered on the 21st to then be told the 29th September. This is now beyond a joke, no1 has any idea why or where they are. I sent a final email asking for another update a few days ago to get the response that it’s now going to be 14th October!! That’s over 3 months to deliver a pair of trainers. What a bloody joke! I just cancelled it and am now waiting for my refund to clear I just got fed up with it as I’m obviously never going to receive what I paid for. I will never buy from Nike ever again purely down to this awful service and the fact no-one has any clue what has happened to my order! DO NOT ORDER FROM NIKE!!!!!!!",2021-09-18T06:45:25.000Z,Nike

Customer service actually lied to me once and said the product was out of stock so it never shipped so I ordered the same product from another site, only to have the shoes from here come a week later.

Due today and had not arrived called and order had been lost and no one at Nike can tell me when the paid for shirt will arrive… apparently there are no supervisors to speak to when you call customer services!

Beware Nike use Hermes,M A,1,"I ordered a pair of trainers from Nike who have always used DPD as their courier. In 10+ years I’ve never had a problem but this time I got an email saying Hermes would be delivering my order. The email said they would deliver between 4pm and 6pm. At 6pm I got an email saying the delivery time had been changed to between 6pm and 8pm. At 6:08pm I got and email saying my parcel had been ‘successfully’ delivered to a neighbour. There was no information about what neighbour my parcel had been left with. This was accompanied by a very badly blurred picture of a box, an open front door and a headless torso in a doorway. I contacted Nike and the customer service agent was very friendly. He said I would have to wait a few days for Nike to contact Hermes to investigate where my parcel is. So I’m now £150 out of pocket and don’t know where or who my trainers where delivered too. This could all have been avoided if Nike had used DPD instead of Hermes the worse parcel courier in the UK.I’m already getting fed up of having to return orders to Nike because of the bad quality of their trainers. I’ve been buying Nike trainers for over 20 years and the quality has really deteriorated in the last few years. There’s also the constant price increases every year. A pair of Nike TN’s that cost £110 back in 2003 and where good quality now cost £155 and fall apart within 3 months. The bad quality, yearly price increases and now Nike using Hermes as a courier have put me off ordering from then again. So beware if you’re in the UK, Nike use Hermes as one of their couriers now so you might not receive your order.",2021-09-17T01:33:39.000Z,Nike

Contacted customer service and was told I would have the send the item back, can't recall and can't refund despite error being at their end, which they acknowledged as being the case. Was told matter was being escalated and I would be contacted. One week later no follow up, contacted again and had to explain all over again, this time I was told a courier would be sent to pick up the item. Then the agent told me they can't actually do that after all, and then abruptly ended the chat rather than deal with the problem. Gave up at that point. Long story short if you like Nike products don't buy direct, awful service.",2021-09-16T11:41:22.000Z,Nike

Ordered 4 weeks in advance as it would normally never take more than 2 weeks to deliver based on all other orders placed previously.  Nike has now lost both products and is refusing to refund my money as their offshore customer service teams they have to first get confirmation the product is lost.  I called the carrier myself and FedEx said they have never received the package and have had no updates from Nike since September 2nd.  So how is it Nike’s massive Supply Chain doesn’t know this????  So I asked to speak to a supervisor and like many other comments on here, a supervisor is never available and I will get a call back in 24 hours.

Nike stole right from a college athlete,Crystal Garcia,1,"On July 1st I ordered two pairs of cleats for my son. It is his first year playing college football. He spent his own money from his grad party a total of $298. It is 09/14/2021 and we have no cleats and no answers. I have called over 20 times, I try to chat online at least once a week and they say I must call. When I call no supervisors are ever available the reps do not speak clear English and all they tell me is my case has been escalated and a supervisor will contact me tomorrow I have heard that for 2 months and not once has a supervisor contacted me. I have tried to cancel my order and obtain a refund they stated I can not due to the order being placed. I am so out done with Nike to have an athlete that receives a scholarship to play college ball and he can't even get the cleats he PAID for and no answers as to where they are or when he will receive them is absolutely obscured. To be such a large company and to just take away from a college athlete is just mind blowing NEVER will myself nor any of my patients order from nike.com again!

My one star is generous to say the…,Eliza,1,"My one star is generous to say the least. I joined Nike and became a member and was told upon joining that each member gets a 25% discount during their birthday month. Firstly this is miscommunicated as it only apply a to certain items. Anyway I tried to place an order via app… rejected. Tried 3 different payments…. Rejected. So I tweet about Nike and receive a reply I am advised by a rep to call up and order via phone the next day. First rep fobs me off saying I’m locked out of my account allow 48 hours and retry. Which I did still cannot purchase. So I call again the lady says that there’s an issue with my account and they will escalate issue to IT please allow 3-5 days. I allow a week nothing. I call again the lady takes my card details and says yep order has gone through and I’m delighted as it was the last day of the month. So I then wait and wait and wait no delivery. Call Nike worries as I’ve had no confirmation apart from verbal and I have given my bank details…. 50 mins later they establish they wasn’t ordered I have now missed out on my discount and they have advised if I ever want to shop with Nike I need to purchase in store. For a multi million world wide company I think they are appalling. They lie to get you off the phone, they are unhelpful and I am so disappointed.

Nike's are cheaply made and it shows,Jamie,2,"After looking everywhere in Calgary for a pair of all black Nike Air Max 90's, my only option was to order them from Nike directly. As per usual, it took quite some time to get them as they came from the US but that was to be expected. When I got them I was actually kinda shocked at how much the quality has gone down in Nike shoes. It's very obvious they are made in a factory with poorly paid workers who don't care ( I don't blame them ). Glue is very obvious and noticeable throughout the entire outside of the shoe, something I expect from brands like Sketchers but for some reason had higher expectations for Nike. It's not worth it to send things back to the US after the shipping cost so I have no choice but to keep them, however I don't know if I would purchase Nike again based on how these look and feel. Maybe if they cut the prices in half to better in line with the quality of shoes they are producing. It would also be nice if Nike put out some women's shoes that were actually aimed at females ie cute colours!!! Put out a Lilac Air Max 90 and people would go crazy, so tired of red, dark green or gold as the only options for personalizing shoes. Girls like cute colours Nike, get on board! Very disappointed all the way around.",2021-09-08T06:13:55.000Z,Nike

Called second time, delayed again. Called third time, they said warehouse is closed until October 18th, no eta on shipment until they reopen. Asked for refund, denied. Went up further, again, “refund denied due to status of order”. Called to speak to the supervisor. Supervisor is never available and will always call back within 24 hours. Several attempts, never a call back.

They were realtively cheap and came with free delivery so already a winner, however, after a week of usage the trainers were not to the standard I would have hoped. As I had thrown away the box, the return slip and used them a few times I would assume that Nike would say a refund was not possible. I jumped on to the chat function was put through to a rep straight away, the dude replied immediately, told me 'he had my back' which was cool. He sent me a new return slip, told me it was cool to return in any box and that i would get a full refund. I have to say awesome service and how it should be for this sort of company. Kudos.

Nike by you shipping is put on hold,Maibritt Nielsen,1,"Nike by you shipping is put on hold, but nobody informs the customers. If they actually explained what happened (not just - it's Covid, because come on we have lived with that for more than a year now), I think I would be less frustrated with the waiting time. Every time I contact them the delivery date is pushed 2 weeks. Shoes that were supposed to be delivered in 3 weeks, are now _estimated_ to be delivered in 11 weeks. Seasons have changed, weather have changed (who am I kidding, I live in California), anyway, this is not good customer service. Tell us why and give us actual delivery estimates, especially since you can't cancel the order, because the shoes are made, packed and ready to be shipped.Nike, I thought I liked you, currently I am not so sure.",2021-08-25T18:03:30.000Z,Nike

DON’T BUY NIKE DESIGN BOOTS YOU’LL NEVER SEE THEM …,Janet Goggins ,1,"My step son designed his own football boots for his birthday. Ordered on 5h July, delivery was 26h July. 2 days before the delivery date we had an email saying they were delayed. No updates received. Went on Nike chat 3 times 2 x told nothing they could do as they couldn’t see problem either !! But they would personally take it over and find us an update. Nothing received. Step sons birthday came and went and we had a broken hearted ridiculed little boy as he had told all his friends his “ special boots with his name on were coming “ today I got somehow on the UK chat to be told all orders were put on hold because of a safety breach. The breach was now sorted and they were just waiting for the orders to restart. However they couldn’t tell me if hat would be days, weeks, months or years. Hey are still allowing orders and taking peoples money we checked. Mean while our 10 year old will be grown with w full beard by the time these bloody boots arrive. They offered me 20% compensation discount off my next purchase!! Not a chance will I be buying from Nike UK ( or in fact any Nike) again. Disgusting from a multimillion pound company, bit looking at the reviews here looks like we are not the only ones. Seems Nike doesn’t give a crap !!",2021-08-24T12:02:19.000Z,Nike

"Nike - don't know, can't help.",PL,1,"I was looking for a new pair of Free RN but couldn't find them anywhere (stores and online). Every retailer I visited said the same thing: We think they've been discontinued but we don't know for sure. Nike never tell us anything. So I tried the support chat on nike.com (available on US site only). Whoever I was typing with found a pair of Free RN but when he/she realized I'm not in the US he/she told me they couldn't help me. I asked if the Free RN had been discontinued and got the reply they don't have any information about that. So I then asked them what else they got with a drop of 5mm or less (low drop - similar to the Free RN-series) and guess what. They could not help me! ""I can't find anything"" the person said and asked me to call the number on my local Nike site (not US).So I did. That number was reconnected to somewhere far away from my country but once both me and the woman on the other end got used to the muffled connection we slowly started to make a sort of interaction in English - not native to either of us. After about 10 minutes we concluded that she didn't know the answer and couldn't find a shoe with a smaller drop than 9mm (which is a large drop). She suggested I should probably look at another brand and that was it. How the hell can a company be so indifferent to it's customers and it's own staff? I mean, the complaints is not about their products. It's about the behavior. I have never ever heard retailers shade a brand like this before. One of the larger ones actually told me: Nike don't care about us one bit.I loved the Free RN series and was really looking forward to buying another pair, but I have to say, this realization has put me off Nike altogether. I just can't understand how you could justify this ""business culture"" as a company.In the end I bought a pair of Saucony Kinvara 12, which isn't exactly like the Free RN but amazing nevertheless.

Nike & Pro direct,Mark Spencer,1,Nike working in collaboration with pro direct are absolutely shocking at dealing with refunds both of their  processes  sre extremely poor to say the least communication is rubbish,2021-07-16T21:59:09.000Z,Nike
Poor handling of issues with couriers,Fiona E,2,"I used to really rate Nike, largely because they offer a great & easy, free returns process, which meant I could order two sizes and not worry about needless hassle and expense returning the one I didn’t want, which other companies have. However, having run into problems that are clearly the fault of DPD courier, my opinion of Nike’s customer service has fallen significantly. Their processes in the case of an indisputable error on the part of the courier (I have photographic evidence) leave the customer caught up in the problems having to wait while Nike and the courier sort it out between them, all the while having paid for goods they haven’t received. This does not happen with other companies who ensure the customer receives their missing items and then they sort out where the problem lay without further inconvenience to the customer. Sadly, therefore, I would be cautious about recommending Nike and, having used them a huge amount over the years, am much less likely to do so again.",2021-07-16T15:45:39.000Z,Nike

The absolute worse customer service …,Eli Easy,1,The absolute worse customer service  I've ever experienced in the last 30yrs and for Nike to be a multi billion company you would think the customer service would be the best of the best. I returned a defective pair of Nike that cost $220 plus tax. I had to pay the shipping cost for the return. I was given a voucher for $220 buy not for the tax i paid nor the shipping cost. I called them 3 days in a row attempting to place a order with the voucher that i still haven't received only to be put on hold for a total of 2+ hrs with all the time from all 3 calls added together. I wouldn't recommend Nike.com to anyone.,2021-07-16T00:51:04.000Z,Nike
Worst Customer service ever experienced,Mr lee spicer,1,Out of all my years never come across such poor customer service from a multi billion pound company.Nike air 720 trainers one deflated after very little use after jumping through loads of hoops I got a return label 8 weeks later still heard nothing.Phoned them today to be told they’re still waiting for my receipt in pdf format I explained I gave everything that was asked for hence I got the return label I said why have you not contacted me for further information he had no answer.The only thing I presume is they just hope people give up.While talking to the adviser I converted my receipt to pdf I await the next excuse.I really don’t know how they’re left to get away with it with so many poor reviews.Really is the worst company I have had the displeasure to deal with I’m never gonna give up it’s the principle of the matter.Please avoid at all costs.,2021-07-15T17:30:53.000Z,Nike

Horribly disappointing technical and customer service experiences,TBurgess,1,"First, their website and app won't allow me to place orders.. going on a couple years now. They can't seem to fix it and it's extremely annoying and inconvenient. So I have to call when I want to place an order, and then deal with someone who barely speaks my language. Placed an order last week, gentleman said he would tie it to my email address and gave me the order #. For days I've tried to get tracking info and it doesn't recognize my email with that order number. I called twice this morning but couldn't get past automation since he didn't get my email right; so I move to chat. They ask a ridiculous amount of questions and tell me no supervisor available. They direct me to call the 800# which I advise I've already done twice and both times disconnected me because I couldn't provide the email the gentleman entered. It's like a maze with Nike these last two years and so disappointing from a brand I love so much. I simply need to stop shopping direct with them and buy my Nikes from other retailers. It not worth the hassle and stress of multiple phone calls and chats to deal with Nike.com.",2021-07-12T13:28:42.000Z,Nike

"Without doubt, the worst customer service ever!",Hidden Findings,1,"I have made several purchases from nike.com, and with each one, I needed to return items, and each time, they failed to refund my money. Even after contacting them several times on each occasion, they told me to expect the refunds, but continued NOT to refund me.On one occasion when using their online chat function, they cut me off three times, so I was forced to repeat myself each time. And on the last occasion, they also cut me off. They clearly have no interest in serving those customers that they have let down the most.On the most recent order, they were out of stock of one item and sent me an e-mail, informing me of the lack of stock and the fact that I would soon be refunded. However, they NEVER refunded me, and even after contacting them 3 times over a 2 month period, they still failed to refund me. Even worse, this time, they told me that they could not refund me, as I had paid with PayPal and that I should contact them instead. And let me be clear... these refunds totalled several hundred pounds - if I hadn't noticed that they were missing, I'd have lost it all.Despite my love of Nike design and clothing, I will never buy anything from this awful online service ever again! If you do, you risk throwing your money away. Do so at your own risk!",2021-07-05T15:26:18.000Z,Nike

Have a pair of Black Air Jordan 12's,Carnel Haynie Jr,1,Have a pair of Black Air Jordan 12's. I walked in them a handful of times since the purchase so the shoes look fairly new. I played basketball in them and my first game my sole game off and I almost rolled my ankle. I was just told because I purchased my shoes two years ago nothing can be done. What a cheap shoe. This reminds me of the Zion Williams shoe blow out incident. I've been purchasing Nike Air Jordans Since 1993 and will never spend another dime of my money on their products. Over the years the shoes have been made cheaper and cheaper and they fall apart. Nike have became more quantity or quality.,2021-07-02T20:49:17.000Z,Nike

Don’t buy Nike...,Andrew Whitehead,1,"A brand like Nike you would expect top notch customer service. My Autistic son had a pair of VapourMax Flyknits which he  saved up and was so proud to own. One of the air pockets defeated, so I called Nike and they suggested I returned them due to them being less than a year old. I sent photos prior to sending as Nike requested a photo to confirm the item. So far it’s been nearly 5 weeks,  I’ve called a dozen times to be told numerous things. First they wanted proof of postage I sent that, which they then said it was incorrect, after four additional calls later  they told me they had misplaced the shoes , but we’re now in a position to process a refund because the escalations team had confused the returns receipt with another item. So you would hope finally I would be sent a refund and in a position to order my son a replacement pair. Nope...! Firstly  they told me the refund was going to be credited to my PayPal, nothing. So I called again a week later to be told they need my international banking code, so I spend  the best part of that evening on the phone with my bank to obtain it. Then when I called back and told the advisor I was calling with my banking information, I was told they hadn’t even processed it and wanted the postage receipt again. One week later and after it’s been escalated 5, yes 5 times they inform me today the item isn’t a Nike product. Which I brought from Nike,com and have the email receipt for them, I asked for a explanation on what that meant and basically was told they are fake, even though they I had purchased from Nike . So  please read this before you take for granted the company today we all love for awesome footwear, they sell fakes to us. Try telling your distressed Autistic son that. Nike you are a complete joke and when,  and I say when I receive my sons shoes back, which I’m skeptical that I will, I’m taking this further.",2021-07-01T23:10:55.000Z,Nike

The only offer free returns if you set up a nike account, even when the return is due to their mistake. I chose the free return option of dropping it off at the Nike store because using their store finder for returns I saw there’s one near my office. On arrival, I’m told they can’t do the return because it’s a franchise store. So I’m back returning by Mail. We’ll see how that goes but not happy that I’ll lose the shipping charges on their mistake.

SCAMMERS,Anita ,1,"So after years of good experience just happened to be scammed by Nike! I ordered something but I had to return it. The tracking site shows that they have received so I contacted them to ask about my refund. They said they're not able to locate my parcel on the depot so I have to wait another 5-8 days while they investigate my parcel's whereabouts. After a few days I asked again when can I expect my refund but an another ""agent"" remind me the investigation could takes 3-5 days. So probably they're know different policy but that's alright. Today I received an email which is mentioned they cannot locate my return so they're not gonna refund me. I mean... WHAT?! There is a proof of shipping and receiving. It's not my business if they got lost my parcel after they received. So I contacted them again on the live chat and they confirmed what I received via email. They're not able to locate my return. They haven't received anything. So question 1 is that: Why the tracking site shows they're received. I've been told there was nothing in the box. Wait, what?! So they cannot locate my parcels or was it empty?! While I asked the costumer service kindly switch off the chat on me and I ended up with a ""you've got all of the information"". The costumer service is unbelievably useless and lying then the best solution what they can produce is to switch off the live chat. Well done!",2021-06-23T14:29:30.000Z,Nike

BOYCOTT THIS WEBSITE,Paul Warhurst,1,"I placed an order twice as it said that my order could not be processed when I pressed to pay and that an item was no longer in stock. Therefore, I believed that the orders had not gone through when in fact they had and this was not made clear in any way.

I was not able to contact customer service as it was after 8pm and the lines were closed so I had no other option than to email them. I woke up to find that the long, detailed email that I wrote out had been a total waste of time as it was completely ignored and the only email I had received in response were informing that both orders had been dispatched! So basically, I paid for the same tracksuit twice and will now have to wait until my order comes, go through the long returns process getting it ready to send back, waiting and worrying while it is in transit, waiting some more for my return to be processed and for the money to finally appear in my account  all because of an error in your website!

Amazing (Un)Customer Service,Jef Ng,1,"I had placed an order for Nike Air Force 1 Low By You back in 10th April 2021. Upon seeing that there was no progress update for ~ 3 weeks in my Nike account, I checked in on the status using a webchat. I was assured that my order would arrive on time. Come 10th May (what is shown in the system as ARRIVES BY 10/05), nothing arrived. By 10pm local time, I contacted a Nike webchat agent, and I was then told my order are not ready yet, and he has no visibility when it would be ready. He said he would escalate the matter and monitor mymy order for me (to which he didn’t), I had no choice but to wait.Thereafter,  I had to contact Nike a few more times who all promised to get back to me BUT NEVER DID. In the end, my order did arrived… and not because CS stepped in.",2021-06-06T23:58:58.000Z,Nike
Shocking service from Nike,Danielle Hitchen,1,I made a large online order from Nike over 10 days ago. It was due to be delivered 5 days ago but nothing arrived. The tracking number supplied for dpd continuely says they haven't received the parcel. Contacted online chat and spoke to Jorilyn who assured me the parcel would be there within a few days. Another 5 days later and still no order and Jorilyn refusing to reply to any emails that is sent. I have now sent 4 emails without getting any reply. Tried the online chat again and spoke to Gil who informed me that no other agent could tell me anything because it was being handled by Jorilyn. Explained how shockingly bad their colleague has been only be be fobbed off again that they would escalate it and have the said colleague contact me with an update...... still waiting!! I will now have to push a charge back with the bank and contact trading standards because this is absolutely appalling from a company of this calibre. Would never order from Nike again and would suggest anyone else think carefully before parting with your hard earned money to this company!!!,2021-06-06T09:39:59.000Z,Nike

I order men sizes because Nike does not carry a 12 in ladies.  I also order a half size larger for swelling during my daily power walks.  This sneaker is like walking in a high heel because it causes your feet to roll forward and blisters the achilles.  I had to stop my walk and call for a car to pick me up because the blisters became unbearable!  I'm sure had I worn the sneakers upon purchase, and contacted Nike, they would have exchanged or refunded.

Poor quality shoes and terrible customer service,Tomek Wagner,1,"I bought a pair of Nike Air Zoom Vomero 14 running shoes on their website for £83 ( they were on offer from a retail price of £119 ) back on September 28th 2020. Shoes were comfortable and great for running. I'd use them 2-3 days a week for running ( between 5 -10km ) . After 3 months, the back inside padding ""pillow"" above the heel started coming off, next month a hole where big toe is appeared in one of the shoes, then padding on the second shoe came off as well, this time making the shoe almost impossible to run in due to discomfort caused. I tried complaining to their customer service, but literally got ignored... They asked me to send photos after which I have never heard back. I contacted them to verify if they received them. Now I'm actually quoting what I've been told that they did receive the photos and ""higher team"" will review the them and get in touch. If you pay so much money for a pair of shoes you don't even use that often, you'd expect them to last more than 6 months! It's that simple.  I have contacted them to see if they were willing to do something regarding this experience. Genuinely any sort response would have been better than just ignoring a complaint of customer providing a genuine feedback on a poor product. Meant to buy another pair of shoes from them, but no thanks! I will get myself ASICS instead just as I used to before trying out Nike.",2021-06-01T13:14:31.000Z,Nike

According to the chart, a 27cm foot needs a size 8 UK... lol The 9.5 UK is perfect in length but super narrow for my feet, how can the size 8UK be the right size for a person with a 27cm foot. I would understand if I bought the wrong size but according to Nike I should've bought a smaller size. Super annoying to have spent so much on poor quality and then only to find out that they dont understand how measurements work. Nike, bro, measurements are constant, people's feet aren't. Just because Kyrie Irving has weird banana shaped feet doesnt mean you can pass it off as a bigger size. Fix your damm chart and label your shoes correctly.

I sent proof of postage so they know I had returned the stuff and they keep telling me they can only refund me for the items they can locate as a customer that is not my problem that you can’t find stuff in the warehouse as far as I’m concerned I sent back every single item that was in my order and the funny thing is they refunded some of the stuff that was in the same box as the other stuff they claimed was empty.now why would send back an empty box?

Ordered a pair of shoes which I requested to be taken to a collection point (Which I use all the time as being a doctor I'm not home most working hours) however the courier decided to take them back to the warehouse at nike and issue a refund? No threat i can reorder them cant i? NOPE they were a limited item and wont restock on their site. No threat they can get them resent out to me and i can make a manual payment for them? NOPE they cant do this either. Okay what about sending me a alternative replacement? Nope cant do this either? Asked for a call back from a manager and all i got was a email saying heres 20% off your next order? This company literally thinks they can do whatever they want. I wouldnt be surprised if the management have taken the shoes that have been resent and gave them to one of their kids (which we all know they have done before and said kids have profitted quite nicely from this premium service)If i could give this company 0 stars i would but the worse i can do is 1 so will have to do i guess.

It's not the first problem with their security practices, I had similar experience in the past. I totally understand caring about the security and I know it's hard to make it right, but Nike's approach is just really bad and not at all customer friendly. The outcome: I just can't make an order no matter how I try.",2021-05-17T13:12:00.000Z,Nike

Ordered 2 pairs of trainers for my…,Verity Qualters,1,Ordered 2 pairs of trainers for my daughters birthday on the 9th may with the delivery date of 17th may. Had an email today from Nike today to say I had submitted a refund which I haven’t. Apparently dpd had returned them🤷🏻‍♀️ No help to me as I still don’t have the trainers & of course the money isn’t in my account yet so that I am able to try & order them form somewhere else. VERY DISSAPOINTED! Especially as Nike can’t tell me if I reorder them if they will be here in time for Friday.,2021-05-17T09:41:14.000Z,Nike

I am giving Nike a one star review…,Terence McClunie,1,"I am giving Nike a one star review because I am so tired of every time I go to order a pair of shoes or clothing it is out of stock. today was the launch of a new pair of shoes that I’ve been waiting for a week and a half to get for my daughter‘s 14th birthday. literally one minute after the shoes dropped they were sold out of the size I needed. I called customer service and he said the shoe sold out in 19 seconds I am a Nike club member and can never get the shoes I want when I want them. what are the perks to being a Nike member?I don’t get how shoes and clothing stay out of stock for months sometimes a whole year. I am confused as to why if they see that their stuff is selling out so fast do they not make more. I mean come on it’s Nike. what, are they only making 10 pair of shoes for the launch. I’m really debating switching to a different brand and find me a new app where items are in stock on a regular basis. Also Nike never sends any kind of coupons, discounts opportunities or anything to its members to be able to use for future purchases. nflshop.com sends you a 20% off coupon every time you buy something from them. I feel like as much money as Nike makes they should be able to take care of their members a little better and do a better job of keeping items in stock on the app.  I have a list of items that I loved and saved and when I go and look at it 85% of it is out of stock. Totally unacceptable. I am Very very very unhappy with Nike!",2021-05-13T14:37:21.000Z,Nike

"No stock, glitchy website, order not going through",local reviewer,1,"To begin with, it is impossible to find a shoe in stock on the Nike website. What’s the point in launching new models if it’s not on your own website but on footlocker or dodgy websites online? This isnt even for one specific model so I liked 4 different models from the AirMax series in plain black nothing special and they were not available on the web only rarely at footlocker (and that company is rubbish online too). THEN I found a similar model the AirMax plus 3 in black only with blue laces so I thought don’t be picky it’s fine. Added it to Cart filled all info and it kept saying “error” etc and just didn’t put the order through despite me trying more than once with different cards. So I said leave this and went to Adidas online and bought myself shoes from their today which has already been shipped. Disgusting stock, ALSO glitchy website, and orders don’t go through. I’d rather pay less at Adidas for better quality and fast service, not once have they done this. So off putting.",2021-05-11T21:02:31.000Z,Nike
Horrible customer service!,Martin,1,"It slightly hurts I have to give Nike.com a star, because I truly believe they deserve zero taking my latest experience into consideration, and I hope nobody (!) experience anything similar at any big company in the future.I actually really likes the brand in every way, and have always done. I also believe there is all capabilities to create the best experience for the customer, both in stores and online, with some great store and online setups visually.With that said, I am deeply sad about my latest experience, which have been devastating for our relationship in the future.I created an order Thursday 6th of May 2021, in the morning at 7.20 (1,5 hours before Nike.com call center opens), and after trying several times without any success with the final steps on creating an order, finally the system accepted my credit card and I receive an order confirmation.At 7.22, two minutes after my order confirmation, I received another order confirmation, out of nowhere, on my email account.I called customer service at the minute they opened, and the assistant I spoke with, promised my to sort it out, without creating any challenges for me, and I thought the case was closed. I actually went out of the conversation with a great feeling of getting a proper customer service.The following day I realize the two orders was ready for shipment. I was, of course, extremely surprised and frustrated I had to use more of my precious time to sort something out that was not my mistake, but decided to call again, to ensure the system-made extra order was cancelled, and the assistant I spoke with promised me to sort it out, and created a refund to go back to my account after 5 business days.Today, 3 business after latest chat with your CS department, I received the order I ordered, but then received emails stating I should have received both orders. I then called again, for the third time, and the assistant I spoke with this time told me:- An orders cannot be cancelled 15 minutes after the creation (but again... I did not create the extra order)- The refund was never created Friday. It would first happen once the product was returned to the warehouse (but I should never have left, since I spoke with you 1,5 hours after your mistake happened), and from this day it would take 5-9 business days (depending on my bank) for the refund to take place- She would start an investigation to find out where the ""missing"" product were (and I had to provide a massive amount of information, that would not have been necessary if the system worked as it should)- She would call me back with an answer after 2-3 business days.I am sitting back, as a customer in your business with a lot of frustration and questions:Why do your assistant(s) provide me a lot of falls information, because everybody says something different vs the prior person I spoke with?Why promise something you cannot live up to? If you are unable to provide a simply service for a mistake you and your system has done, then be honest, at least.Why do I need to call you this many times to sort out something an issue you have created for me?How come can it be me that has to prove something, with an order I have done everything in my power, to help you sort out? When will I get my money back?I am sitting back, as a customer with the feeling that I have done something wrong, especially when needing to deal with assistants who meets me with equal frustration/anger and does not believe a word I say, despite this is something you also state in your customer service call intro you seem to have experiencing beforehand.One thing, I will promise you: I will never shop with you on your website again. And unlike you, I will keep my promise! Despite being a big fan and impressed about your efficiency with the order, especially taking into consideration that it was customized, I really think I have used too much time and energy on this issue.I hope to hear from you!KRMartin Markvardsen",2021-05-11T20:02:37.000Z,Nike

Flyease Line Rocks for This Disable Man!,Patrick Skater,5,"I have an incomplete spinal cord injury and I have difficulty completing tasks that rely on my hands. I was looking for sneakers I can put on independently. I like to go for a good long walk using my Rollator walker and I need a quality shoe. I also prefer to be more stylish so I’m not interested in the usual Velcro options offered for folks like me. Luckily, NIKE has the new Flyease line. I tried several sizes and models before finding a perfect fit in the Nike air zoom Pegasus 38 model. The Nike representatives were awesome in helping me figure out what would work and the return policy made it quick and easy, not to mention cost free, to try out different shoes. I also enjoy the dry fit line of clothing. It’s perfect for Arizona weather.

Hate Nike!!! no service,Diana ,1,"Hate Nike!!!! More than 5 (!!!) orders in a row were cancelled, no matter what payment method - I've tried them all by the way. No reason for cancellation, ""contact your payment provider"", well I've contacted all my banks, paypal and gift voucher provider and they had no issues to process all the other transactions I've made the very same day. I would give up months ago as anyway lots of people saying that Nike's quality now is a joke - leggins could be thrown away just after couple of the weeks, it's not the same qulity it was 5 years ago. Unfortunately, I've purchased gift voucher which is obviously unrefundable and Nike doesn't let me to spend it cancelling ALL my orders! Customer service is absolutely useless, they ""open a case"" for you and say ""they will contact you with an update"" which never happens (as you could probably guessed already). Avoid at all costs!

Unreliable delivery even when you pay extra,Janet Trombetta,1,Don’t count on Nike to get your item on time even if you pay extra to get it there.

How embarrassing!!  I asked what compensation do I get so I can run to the nearest store and buy something else to bring ( even a gift card for another Nike product) I got sorry Miss my supervisor said no. “ It’s not our policy to compensate for untimely delivery even if you pay extra”,2021-04-16T15:36:19.000Z,Nike

"Nike Ordering systems, policies and returns SCAM",Brian West,1,"Just spent an hour dealing with customer service, I don't blame the customer service agent or supervisor for the inadequate return policies and online scam ordering system because the lower level people are a veil to keep the people making the programs and systems untouchable just like every other bad online ordering system out there that screws people over. If it wasn't for a long history of wearing Nike basketball shoes and having a difficult time finding my size instore- I would NEVER order from the online website.Nike sent and charged me for the same order twice and at first they didn't want to give me a refund until they receive there extra pair of shoes back that I never ordered in the first place. I argued to get the refund back because I work on a budget and can't have people overcharging for ish then tell me when then can and can't return funds because of their bullish policy. They basically stole from me in the first place and now holding money that doesn't belong to them. So now I have to wait 5-7 business days to receive a refund-way too long also, and on top of that I will be charged again if they don't get their extra shoes back in the next two weeks-how am I supposed to know they'll get there shoes back in time if they cant even catch mistakes in their ordering systems? If a company makes a mistake like this, especially one as global as Nike, they should eat it plain and simple, I don't believe in policies unless they relate to peoples circumstances and show that a company owns its mistakes.5 minus stars",2021-04-15T17:27:56.000Z,Nike

If nothing now goes wrong it will have been one of the smoothest shopping experiences I have had outside of Amazon prime. If anything does go wrong I will update. I am just glad I ordered before I saw these shocking reviews. Are they for real???? I am within the UK.So, a few days later: Trainers arrive via DPD our best UK courier, full tracking provided and actually earlier than estimated, and the trainers are exactly as described and expected and even more comfortable/better quality than I could have hoped.

2021 DON'T ORDER NIKE,Alexa Guilliot,1,"2021 - I ordered a pair of shoes online and paid extra for quicker shipping.  The shipping was not only late, but it took longer to ship than what it would have at the regular shipping price.  The shoes not only did not fit, even though they were the correct size, they also felt cheap and like the soles were made of plastic.  I immediately requested a refund.  They sent an email with a ""shipping label"", but because I do not have a Nike account, I had to also pay for one at FedEx.  Also, UPS, Nike's suggested carrier, would not ship my nike refund.  I had to find a FedEx location to do so.  7 days pass and I see that my order has arrived at their facility.  I have received no email saying they've received the shoes and no estimate of the amount of time it would take to refund my order.  I called customer service and had to dispute that they did in fact receive the shoes when they tried to claim otherwise.  I got verbal confirmation that my refund would take 21+ days and that an email was sent.  Have yet to receive an email.  I don't expect service like this from my local stores much less a multi-billion dollar company.  Support nike at your own risk!",2021-04-12T16:29:26.000Z,Nike

What a waste of time Nike are!,Craig ,1,"Well where do I start?  I've been trying to place an order for over a week and can only conclude Nike do not need my business!I initially placed quite a large order for shorts, trainers and a tracksuit and was given an error message of 98D2586B. I tried again later thinking it was a one off glitch but I got the same error.I called the Customer Services number and was told that it could be worth deleting cookies and cache data from my laptop and try placing the order again. Didn’t work!I called again and explained that their solution didn’t work and this time another advisor said this message relates to a problem with the payment because the shipping address and billing address were different. I thought this would be quite a common thing with orders being placed, but I tried his suggestion of changing both addresses to my old address and then I should call customer services to change the shipping address. No joy, same error message. I was also advised to try paying with a different card. Same error!So I called them again and tried to place the order over the telephone. I was on the call for nearly 30 minutes providing all of the item codes and colours/sizes etc. I gave my card details and was told it would not go through. Same error! At this point I was told to wait 24 hours for it to clear and try placing the order again.I waited 24 hours and got the same error again. I called again and they apologised for the issues and said I should go through my order again. Another 30 minutes, and another error message! She said she would refer it now to their Payments team.I waited three days and no call from their Payments team as promised. So I called up for a fifth time. The guy then says I would need to call my bank to confirm that they weren’t putting the stop on the payments. I told them I had already wasted about two hours trying to place this order, with two separate cards and I’m not going to call the banks. The cards are working fine and this was their issue. He said the Payments team would not look in to it unless I called my banks. At this stage I was extremely annoyed and told them what a waste of space they are!So now I’ve given up with Nike. Clearly they do not need the business and aren’t interested in resolving an issue that clearly lies with them and their systems!Don’t waste your time people – look elsewhere!",2021-03-31T17:00:57.000Z,Nike

Wait, what???I have sneakers which were worn much more often with no tear, yet they are in pristine condition.  How they came to that conclusion I’ll never know.

Seems not (And do not tell me Nike had no idea because product detailing would have been spoken about from the design, to the colour, the stitching and advertisement and sales pitch.Nike clearly knew) Lil nas has issued a reply via a music video sexually, giving the devil a lap dance.

I was extremely disappointed on my last transaction. I tried to purchase two pair of shoes from the NIKE web site. I was ok with waiting a week to receive them but then the days came and went . I contacted customer service and explained my concern about not receiving the products on the promised date. I was expecting oh no worries it will be there or sorry its late. When i got "" It hasnt left here yet"" that was a little bothersome. During the chat i felt like the customer service rep had dismissed the whole thing and me as a customer. i asked what could be done and was told nothing for now lets just wait and see if they show up tonight. they just told me it hadn't shipped how on earth could i get it tonight. Unless somehow they have Santa's sleigh and reindeer. so i said well i guess we should cancel. She was way to quick to pull that trigger and the order was cancelled and she was on her way. Well Brittani i am guessing you are getting a lump of coal this year. NIKE is this your idea of how to treat a loyal customer if so i guess i will be changing brands.

Long time customer no more !,Joseph Serpico ,1,We placed a order to be customized for our local soccer team. The order shipped late and came in the wrong color and defective. Unfortunately we did not have time to complete the lengthy return process per the Nike representative request due to receiving merchandise late and we were in need of the merchandise before the next sporting event so we were forced to use damaged merchandise. We had offered a compromise for Nike to offer some type of discount on our next order to make things right. The Nike representative offered NOTHING and also refused to allow us to speak to any other Nike representative to better help to come to some type of resolution. I was very disappointed that our trust in Nike had been broken and we will no longer be a Nike family.,2021-03-27T21:04:17.000Z,Nike
Snkrs App,DARWIN TROUPE,1,"If I could put a negative 5 I would. Your Snkrs App still doesn’t have ‘ I’m not a bot’ verification process. So that leads me to believe you are in bed with the resale websites. I remember when you could order a pair of shoes and not have to worry about getting scoped by one person with multiple bots in play. A lot of less appealing sites have the counter measure against bots. But Nike has not made the necessary upgrade to the system to slow down the price gouging from the aftermarket sites. I’m sneaker head tried and true. I’m not in for the resale, I buy shoes now because when I was a kid my parents could afford Nikes for 3 boys & a girl. But no worries, your losing more old head consumers then you think. But I’m sure with resale money getting funneled back to Nike you will continue to stay deep in the black.",2021-03-27T14:36:00.000Z,Nike
Dishonest and Unreliable,Asher Dust,1,"I ordered two pairs of Nike trainers as a gift. Order processed fine. A few days later I received an email to say that my order had been cancelled. Reason given, insufficient funds, as well as other reasons eg, customer error etc. This is a total fabrication. I had more than enough funds, I also double checked my details when I entered them. Furthermore I had purchased several items online from other places. If Nike had sold out, at least admit it, then move on. I double checked my bank, as well as sufficient funds, there was no notification from Nike!!I absolutely have no interest in dealing with them again. Lesson learned.",2021-03-27T13:14:36.000Z,Nike

One pair the right shoe sounded like it was designed with a toddler squeaker built-it and the skin started to peel after less than 6 months use.  Now my second pair is starting to do the same.  I sent in one pair for the Nike warranty and they denied the claim.  What a waste of time and money and now I learned after denying the claim they destroy the shoes rather than return them to the customer.

Had to ring them and I was told the paperwork was incorrect, and Nike was at fault.

My query was why haven't you processed my refund when I can see that you received it over 2 weeks ago. It has taken 2.5 weeks for my £350 refund to be processed. Absolutely no regard for the customer, no support or urgency to assist you, and after the 3rd time contacting customer ""services"" they had the cheek to wish me a happy Nike day after telling me my case would need to be investigated. Just another example of a big company who doesn't care about customer experience, relying on brand loyalty to keep customers.

Worst online shopping experience I ever had,Elena P.,1,"This was the worst online shopping experience I had in many years, maybe ever. I've spent a good few hours trying to buy a pair of sneakers.First, my birthday discount code was called ""invalid"", although it was well within the promo period, copy-pasted with precision from the Nike email. I ended up not using it.Second, I kept getting cryptic error codes when checking out, tried different bank cards, and payment methods to no luck.Third, when I finally managed to complete the purchase (by creating a new account, clearing all cookies (!) and paying with PayPal), my order got cancelled 2 days later. And the sneakers I wanted to buy are now unavailable.When speaking to customer service representative about the cancellation, they said that my ""billing details couldn't be verified"", which doesn't make any sense: PayPal was happy and successful in taking the payment, my bank was happy to charge the account, I use these billing details on dozens of other sites, my browser auto-fills them (but of course I double checked them too), and they even match my delivery address.

The Nike scam…,Gregory Wolfinger,1,"On February 12th my wife was scammed into buying Nike gift cards. I immediately contacted Nike and they stopped the transaction. They sent me an email saying the funds have been secured and are being held by Blackhawk, the company that administers their gift cards. The email also stated that the store where the cards were purchased should contact Blackhawk and the funds would be transferred to the store. Then the store could reimburse me. So Dave the manager of Food Lion contacted Blackhawk and for 45 minutes was stonewalled by them. They refused to send the funds to Food Lion.I exchanged several emails trying to resolve this but they say there is nothing they can do and would not reply to any further emails.I am a senior over 75 years of age. So from my perspective Nike is not only taking advantage of seniors but are scamming people who have been scammed.",2021-03-13T15:11:21.000Z,Nike
No respect or fake offers,Harris Papadopoulos,1,"I ordered a kid's jacket for 60 euro and some socks. My order no. C00456056151. The possible delivery date passed without me receiving anything. When i tried to call customer support their answer was that there was a problem and the order was never sent. I asked if i did something wrong or if i missed any info mail from them but they told me that it was not my fault and i should make the order again. Only, that now the same jacket had a price tag of 85 euro instead of 60... I would never expect such behaviour from a brandname of this size. In my opinion it was a fake offer and they changed their mind about the price. They even refused to let me order it again with the same price since they saw my order and the price i originally ordered. NEver heard the real reason (or even a fake one) i didnt receive my order neither i was informed that i am not. My son was waiting for the jacket..

I waited the additional 24 hours and it still didn’t work.

5 months waiting for an online gift card,Chada GC,1,"I ordered a gift card online for my friend's birthday in October. Two weeks later, it hadn't arrived so I queried with Nike who explained it said it had been delivered on their end but were going to try and help. Gift card suddenly showed up a week later and this is where the ordeal began. I usually don't go out of my way to give bad reviews but I was completely appalled and have JUST received a replacement online gift card....5 months later.1) The gift card code for the original gift card was invalid. We were told on different occasions that it was used, invalid, expired, an incorrect Nike gift card and it was a £250 card for Vitality (so they told us to contact a completely different company). Not once did anyone try to rectify this. 2) I cannot count how many times I chased up just getting a replacement gift card e-mailed to me so I could nip this in the bud. Every two weeks I was told it would be dealt with and would be resolved that very week. 3) It is now March and I have been forwarded the gift card by e-mail. I haven't received an apology, or an acknowledgement of how much time I have wasted with this ordeal - literally ""here's your gift card code and pin"". From the looks of all the reviews there is a real problem with ordering online from Nike and understandably with the pandemic this was bound to happen. However in my situation, the buck has been passed too many times to count and it's clear Nike has to get its formalities and training procedures in check for problems like these!",2021-03-02T10:59:34.000Z,Nike

A very disrespectful attitude from such a large corporation.  I recently wanted to buy some running shoes and would usually have gone straight to the Nike website.  Not this time though ... I bought ASICS trainers and they are absolutely fantastic.  Good bye Nike!,2021-02-27T16:28:10.000Z,Nike
NIKE.COM ARE LIARS,Ivor Gilkes,1,"On Fen 12, 2021 I purchased a pair of Air Jordan V Low Golf Shoe men's size 9 from from NIKE.COM. On the same day I purchased a separate pair of sneakers from he same site. It is Feb 27, 2021 and I only received the other sneakers. When I continue to contact NIKE. COM about my Jordans they keep giving excuses that due to inclement weather the sneakers have not been shipped. I considered their excuses and today on Feb 27, 2021 I received the other sneakers but never received my Jordans. Nike.com chat representatives continue to lie and say that my Jordans are being sent from Memphis TN and the weather held up the shipment and my other order came from a different warehouse, which is a lie. My other sneakers came from Memphis, TN, which is the same warehouse that the Jordans were supposed to be shipped from but never arrived and still have not been shipped. They had to nerves to send me a tracking number for my Jordans without sending the sneakers to Fedx. I will be filing a small claims lawsuit because they took my money from my credit card but refuse to send me my item i purchased. They continue to blame the weather with their lies and on the NIKE.COM website it is showing my item have been shipped when it is not. This is a distrustful website and they should be ashamed but it's obvious they do not care about their reputation because all of the reviews show they are dishonest.Your order is on its way.Ordered Feb 12, 2021 - Order #C00460820578Purchased Online.Shipped — Arrives Thursday, Feb 18Air Jordan V Low Golf ShoeAir Jordan V Low$220.00Golf ShoeBlack/Metallic Silver/White/Fire RedSize M 9.5 / W 11",2021-02-27T16:23:46.000Z,Nike
Bleeding Carmines 🤬🤬🤬,Roddale Wynn,1,"Finally got my retro 6 Carmines from Nike and the sneakers app and I was totally disappointed! The shoes are complete trash!! The red color is bleeding into the white on the side of the shoes, and its also bleeding into the sole of the shoes! My entire shoe looks red and pink instead of red and white like they should. Some people are saying ""well thats just how some of them are showing up, you bought them so thats your problem! Noooo...its Nike's problem not mine, and Im not the only person who feels this way. These are the worst pair of Jordan's that I have ever purchased in years! Im so disappointed in Jordan Brand, and Nike for the quality of this particular shoe! I really wanted these because it was the first time in almost 30 years that they were released with the Nike swoosh on the back! I will be returning mine to the Nike store in Smithfield NC to get a complete refund! Good luck to those of you who are having the same problem.",2021-02-27T12:05:19.000Z,Nike

Most efficient returns process I’ve ever seen,Kirsty Forrester (frostyterrier),5,"I purchased some running shoes from the Nike GB online shop. They were despatched and delivered very quickly. They ended up being too big for me so I had to return them. The returns process was the easiest and fastest I’ve ever experienced with any online shop ever. I took them to the post office on Thursday, and by Monday the return had been acknowledged and the refund had been submitted to my credit card. The returns process was so easy that it made me confident enough to try another pair of running shoes. The second pair were also delivered quickly and this time they fit perfectly and I love them. Thank you Nike",2021-02-26T10:12:48.000Z,Nike

Whole experience is usless. Someone needs to fix their systems.,Ken,1,"Usless trying to place orders. All details correct, payments, etc correct. Confirmed through customer services and phone multiple times. Payment gets taken every time only to be cancelled hours later. Every time they say it's a bank issue. Bank fraud team confirms they allowed all payments, Nike accepted all payments. Nike then decided to not take payment and gave no reason, as there is none on my end. However senior team said it's bank again, it's not. The problem is where the payment goes to later on and the senior team. Same issues, every time no fault on my end. Fill you with same B.S. every time and say issues are sorted. I payed missed out on so many drops and items because of this and no one at Nike is capable of fixing the issue. Problem is with the UK branch. Spoke to the US branch and they said everything seems fine but they can't fix issues caused by the UK branch. Wish I could get paid to be useless.",2021-02-17T15:25:44.000Z,Nike

Once this was inputted, it just went back to the main page. So I had to 'buy' again, it then sent another text then asked me to re-input payment details. Then an error code showed. I had to go through this text/payment details process another THREE TIMES, then another error code showed so I refreshed - and the item was sold out.I contacted their live messaging and the advisor basically said it was my fault for not taking a picture of the code (who does that?) and that's life.Slow clap for Nike. Probably the worst online services I've ever used - terribly designed transaction system and arsey advisors. I promptly deleted my account.

Waiting 4 months + for a refund gift card,Caroline Donohoe,1,"I got a pair of Nike Air Max 270 for my son in July 2020 costing €150.00. By Oct the sole of the shoe was pulling away so I contacted Nike.com to see if I could get them replaced.  They gave me a return label which I had to send the runners back which cost €18.00 but they said if my claim was approved this would be refunded also. On the email it said once approved I would get a gift card within 2 weeks.  After 3-4 weeks I contacted Nike and was told my claim was approved and I would receive an email with my gift card.  Great you would think...but No.  Roll on 4 months and after numerous calls and online chat...at last on 15th Jan '21 I received my gift card (without the postage) but at that stage I was just glad to get the voucher.  (Even though I had bought and paid for another pair of Nike Air Max 270 in the meantime) Now wait for it.... 2 weeks later I went onto their website to order a pair of runners for my daughter, put in the voucher code and pin and it said balance NIL.  So now I am back to square one of this saga.  To say I am ready to explode is an understatement. I don't think I have ever dealt with a company with a customer service as bad as this.  When I contacted them got the usual bull of we will escalate it to their seniors but no explanation of how I got a gift voucher with a zero balance....",2021-02-16T13:55:40.000Z,Nike

Worst online shopping experience of my life!,Rodrigo Rodriguez-Fernandez,1,"I current work as a doctor in one of the most hard hit CPVDI19 cities in the world. I use running as an outlet to release stress from the day. I decided to treat myself this December by ordering a pair of running trainers online. When they arrived and did not fit, I went to the local Nike store to see if I could get another pair. Given their low stock, they suggested they take the trainers and they would help place a larger size order online. After a month, I called to ask about my order. They had lost my order. When I asked if they could send another, they said NO and all they could do was return my money and I would have to buy them again. I have been on the phone to them a total of 11 times since December. This is what I have been made to do now while I have time off from seeing COVID19 patient. Speak on the phone to Nike and explain the situation over and over again, asking for my refund with no results. Needles to say, I still have not received my refund and every time I call I have to explain the situation again. I have send endless bank statements etc. Nothing seems to work.

I’ve waited for a week and did not get any return so I contacted them several times via „report an issue“- no answer. Then I tried via only chat several times until I got an answer. The guy was beyond rude, trying to belittle me and telling me how to properly handle picking up orders. I made clear that I did not receive a note and he was just like „you always get a note from the delivery guy“ We all know this is not the case- at all, especially nowadays. It’s whatever, he did manage to get me my refund and mentioned in a rude manner that I should check where my parcel is earlier than a month Next time. I ask if this was normal for him to treat customers like that, when he doesn’t even know the circumstances why someone was not able to pick it up. Just disgusting how people treat other people. His answer was btw, that he always makes the point clear. So I guess it’s normal to get bad customer service at Nike.

"Absolutely nasty, arrogant and corrupt organisation.",Darius the Great,1,"Absolutely nasty, arrogant and corrupt organisation. I purchased three higher end models from them: Air Max Plus III, VaporMax Plus and Air Max 270 and they all arrived with damaged boxes. I returned them for refund and all were successfully delivered - I had used their own prepaid returns labels and posted them via Yodel and Royal Mail. Once delivered I reminded them that I wanted my money back, and their answer was they had not received any of them!. Despite me showing evidence of each successful delivery they had the nerve to claim they had all not been received!. Daylight thieves!. They refused for many weeks to hand over the refunds owed to the point where I had to open PayPal cases to recover the money. PayPal decided in my favour in all three cases, but Nike claimed they still had not received anything!. It is beggar's belief how stupid their staff are. They then went on to block my debit cards, my addresses, and my two Nike accounts because they said that I was 'fraudulent' and that anyone who makes a Chargeback against them or opens a PayPal claim against them will be automatically blocked. They said they will never be reopening my accounts. They are rotten to the core.",2021-01-23T02:21:54.000Z,Nike

They have the worst website experience,Sherlyn Jenkins,1,"They have the worst website experience.  I haven't felt this furious in years.  My college son living away from home tried to order a bunch of items for his birthday.   We have a family credit card that we share.   Nike rejected the cc for no reason.  Card has absolutely no issues.   I told him I would place the order for him assuming his wifi had issues.  It rejected cc my house too.   I called the company and rep  told me his account was locked.   I hung up and I made my own account and it rejected my cc again because apparently it's now a blocked card.  Then I tried and different card and it was rejected.  I called company and tried to use 3 different credit cards including my debit with representative on the phone.   The customer service guy said my account was locked and once it's locked, no new cards work. It also takes days to unlock it and apparently this happens ALL OF THE THIME   He said it would take several days for Nike to even get back to me.   I couldn't even place the order over the phone. I even tried checking out as guest but no luck because once credit card is blocked, it blocks all cards through the IP address, phone number,  email etc.   This is completely idiotic.  I am a customer ready to buy goods and they can't process an order.   Nike rep told me to go buy a gift card and it would work.  Not happening!  This is the first time I've ever had a cc rejected online. I will never shop their website again.  After reading this website, I see it happens to other people too!

They lie to you blatantly and doesn't even think to hold your items to the side. What kind of company does this?I'm very upset and expected more from NIKE.Even after speaking to a representative on the phone for 20 minutes, she offered to send a coupon for my troubles.. confirmed my email and never sent.

Strangely disjointed Service,Michael Cauldwell,1,"Very odd experience. I placed an order for a pair of running trainers, using a birthday discount and gift vouchers. The order was processed efficiently, and the trainers arrived but were half a size too small (no fault of Nike's). Unfortunately, there was no stock of the half size up.I contacted the Nike team via chat, and explained that I wanted to return the shoes, and exchange them for an alternative which didn't have the toe box, and would fit me. I was assured that they had set everything to trigger the exchange automatically once the replacement shows were returned.Three days later, I received a notification to say that my replacement shoes were being dispatched. When I checked the order, exactly the same model, colour and size as i had just returned were being sent back to me. Again I reached out to the team on chat, who this time told me that they can only exchange like for like, and can't exchange for different models. I questioned where the logic was in sending me back the same shoes I'd just returned, but was told that they had assumed I'd meant the same shoe, in black?!  I re-read the previous chat and had clearly stated the different model. In any case, they weren't even sending me the previous shoe in black, it was literally the same one.Nike also told me that they couldn't cancel the dispatch, and that I had to wait to get the tracking number, and then contact them again so they could get in touch with DPD to see if it could be cancelled.It's a very strange and disjointed process for such a big brand. Also, given their boasts on the packaging about reducing the carbon footprint etc. etc., it's laughable that they don't have a process in place to be able to cancel incorrect orders in house. They'll wait for it to be dispatched, ship out to the customer unnecessarily and then do what they can.Pretty rubbish experience all around - very much computer says no and a complete lack of joined up thinking.",2021-01-18T12:58:38.000Z,Nike

Poor quality and limited AF1 design options via Nike By You.,Tony Worsfold,2,"I'm a massive fan of the classic suede AF1 trainers, but Nike have stopped making them. My partner did her best to design a pair using the customise option (paying a considerable premium in the process) as an Xmas gift. Unfortunately the availabile materials are limited to the usual (boring) soft leather, or ""rippled leather"". My other half went with rippled as it was 'different'. Unfortunately, when they arrived, the rippled leather looks like cheap shiny plastic rubbish, nothing like leather at all. Also, she ordered a size 9.5, which came up nearer a 10.5-11. I had about an inch of space in the toe. I reached out to their customer service to ask why such limited options, considering the expense of customised trainers, but received a generic response stating there are no plans to offer a wider range of materials. Avoiding the actual question of ""WHY"".Needless to say the trainers are on their way back, and we are waiting for a full refund. Unfortunately, it looks like I'm going to break my run consecutive pairs of AF1's. Currently looking at DC shoes as a potential permanent replacement. Disappointed!",2021-01-14T19:59:36.000Z,Nike

Contacted Nike cs through chat and rep was unwilling to do anything but tell me tracking details of which i was already aware. The shoes i purchased cost $500, which is an astronomical price, of course, which makes clear how much i wanted them in the first place. Reps should be making exceptional efforts never mind the basic one that was lacking today to connect customers to their desired products-this was supposed to be a late Christmas gift to myself not a hassle and point of frustration due to the poor effort of Nike’s chat representative.Perhaps opt to call rather than message: my experience on the phone has always been positive: that option was not viable for me today unfortunately.",2021-01-06T21:05:55.000Z,Nike

Worst customer service experience…,Deborah Nash,1,"The worst customer service experience I’ve ever had. I would highly recommend you avoid Nike and shop at one of the many other competitors who have vastly better customer service policies. Nike cares about money, they honestly couldn’t care less about you as a customer. I received some Nike shoes as a Christmas present. These were purchased from the Pitt Street, Sydney Nike store. They weren’t my style, so I decided to exchange them as there were 3-5 different shoes I preferred on the Nike website. The pair of shoes I received were full price, unworn and I had the receipt (which was less than 30 days after the sale) so I assumed this wouldn’t be a problem. My husband took the shoes back to the Nike Pitt Street Store. None of the 5 shoes I preferred were available. But, we couldn’t get a refund. Apparently this wasn’t their policy. I was surprised and disappointed at this as I worked in footwear retail for two large companies during university and both would always refund unworn stock within the given exchange period if proof of purchase was presented. I also working at head office for two fashion retailers during my corporate career, and both also offered refunds. So, I am familiar with the retail space. I decided to try and exchange the shoes again and took them to the Nike, Birkenhead Point outlet. Again, none of the shoes I had seen on the website were available. Nothing remotely similar was available. There was also no signage explaining their strict return policy at the store entry.I decided to ring another Nike store, Burwood, to see if they had any products that might be suitable for an exchange. The staff member was helpful and looked up a number of products for me, none of which were available. Instead of offering a refund, all stores offered a credit or exchange. However, I went out of my way to find a product at 3 stores that was suitable for exchange and there was nothing available. It did not help that the products listed on their website were different from those instore, and there was no function on the website to determine what products were available at what stores. These shoes were expensive. It is not useful for me to have over $200 of dead Nike credit when I don’t like any of their products. Particularly in this economic climate.This type of return policy is not common and so should have bee made obvious through inshore signage and verbally by staff at point of sale. I’m imploring anyone reading this to NOT shop at Nike. They waste your time and money. There are so many fantastic competitors in this category (i.e Platypus, New Balance, JD Sports), who have much better refund policies - you have a choice!",2021-01-05T02:08:28.000Z,Nike

I have contacted Nike pretty much every 1-2 weeks via chat/phone to be fobbed off at every occasion. On one of these calls, a Nike call handler told me I had sent back an empty box! Fast forward to December, now told I need to send a bank statement as proof of purchase, despite sending all of this in October, to wait a further 5-8days. That takes upto present day, where i’m told another 3-4 weeks to wait. Throughout, no correspondence, no updates as assured by Nike staff when enquiring.I am rarely moved to make consumer reviews, positive or negative but this is the worst experience I have ever had. If there was a zero star option this still would be too generous.",2021-01-02T11:08:16.000Z,Nike
I ordered (and paid) for joggers on Dec…,Heather VanVorhis,1,I ordered (and paid) for joggers on Dec 11. Dec 12 Nike sent me a UPS tracking number via email saying my item shipped. I never received the Christmas gift for my son. When I call UPS to track they tell me Nike created the tracking number but never gave them the merch. When I talked to Nike they say UPS has the merch. Nike refunded my $ but no longer have the item in stock. Very disappointing. I ordered in plenty of time for Christmas and assumed they were on their way. If I would have known Nike didn’t follow through on their end I could have reorders or found a replacement gift instead of spending hours trying to find my sons $100 joggers!!!!,2021-01-01T18:50:23.000Z,Nike

After 2 weeks of non-stop calls they still have ignored me every time I have made contact. Buyer beware, if you need help you will receive nothing.

Outdated system and a really bad…,Jon Jakobsen,1,"Outdated system and a really bad experience. I ordered a product which I needed to change to a different size. For this to happen I had to call in, send the product back and then they would send me the new size. After 10 days I didn't hear anything so I called them again, they now tell me that the product is out of stock in the chosen size and that instead they would give me a refund and a 20% off voucher. This is useless.. The product was in stock when I placed the exchange. I asked the representative the first time if it would be easier if I just bought the new product and then send this other one back, but he assured me that this was easier.

As soon as I question it, again I get cut off by the rudest most unhelpful advisor yet!Shocking, says alot that they don't have a complaints department either.I will be writing to the ombudsman should this not get sorted fast.Its borderline theft as I dont believe I'll recieve said refund.Global company....

Nike UK is incapable of fulfilling orders - AVOID!,W G,1,"tl;dr: the worst order fulfilment I have ever experienced. 15 days with no dispatch and nobody who can give me any information as to the item's whereabouts. Order placed for a pair of overpriced running shoes on the 22nd November, with the 2-4 day delivery option. Instantly given a delivery day of 1st December, which was quite a lot later but not a major issue.It's now the 8th December, and numerous 'Nike Representatives' have been utterly incapable of helping me locate the order. Instead, they inform me that I am not the only person with this issue, and that they are struggling to locate orders and fulfil them. The appropriate response in a situation like this would be to close the website to further orders until you have caught up with demand. There is not any indication on the website that orders cannot and will not be fulfilled.  It appears that most Nike customers in the UK are in the same boat.For an extremely wealthy global brand whose image is synonymous with speed and excellence, this is a very sad place for them to end up. I wonder if the American HQ is aware that their UK wing has been outsourced to incompetents?",2020-12-08T17:59:58.000Z,Nike
I wanted to buy some gift cards and…,Erica,1,"I wanted to buy some gift cards and tried to buy them, to save time, through the website and then through the app. No joy with neither option so I bit the bullet and rang their customer service and after 10 mins of holding, I got through and ordered the cards. I had the email confirming the order. And this is where Nike failed me. After not receiving the cards by the date stated and finding out that the pending payment had ’disappeared’ from my bank I contacted customer service ( Generous ) who assured me that my order would be fulfilled and that I would receive an email from her/him updating me and with a link. Suffice to say no email. So I am again back on the phone and Ignacio will ’escalate ’ this problem/complaint. He also questioned my bank...had they refused payment? I assured him they hadn't and if they had surely Nike would have contacted me re: problems with payment. Given that the payment had been pending for 4 days then disappeared I dismissed his query.Now you won't be surprised he promised that I would receive an email, because it had been escalated, from a superviser / manager. I haven't !All in all the whole experience has been shocking  A HUGE company like Nike cannot fulfill an order...which in itself is not that complicated. To date I’m still not sure if I will get my order and so will have to source gift cards from other retailers. If I could have got the cards elsewhere - Amazon, Supermarket I would have and I’m almost sure  the experience and customer service would be far better than Nike.",2020-12-07T19:09:48.000Z,Nike
DO NOT use Nike for company orders or large orders,Brittany Bradley,1,"I am placing a large order for Nike for my company. The process at this point has taken about 3 weeks. I am committed to it at this point because I've spent so much time, but am not even close to having my order completed. I cannot get on the line with any human who can help me through issues, and keep getting told my request is being escalated. It takes 2-5 business days to get even a single question answered, and that answer comes in the form of an email, that has a no-reply. It's impossible to troubleshoot, the customer service cannot fix anything, only escalate, and to get a problem resolved you have to start from the ground floor every time. I work for a Silicon Valley tech company, and I'm 30. I'm not someone who doesn't know how to use technology or place orders. Their system is antiquated, hands-off, and over-all offers no resolutions and horrible customer service. DO NOT order bulk company orders from Nike.",2020-12-07T18:55:46.000Z,Nike

Refund not received!!,Nat,1,"I ordered a pair of trainers for my daughter from Nike online on 11th November 2020 as I was getting 25% discount.  I then had to return the trainers to the Nike store on 14th November, due to them not fitting my daughter and I required an exchange to a bigger size.  I did not want to return them online as the discount was no longer available and I would have to pay full price for the exchanged pair.When I returned the trainers, they did not have a pair in the size I required in store, so would order them online for me to receive them to my home address.  When the store assistant put the return through the trainers came up with another discount code applied.  The store assistant returned £20 to my original card payment.I received my confirmation email and all looked good, but this is when the problem starts.  The delivery date I had been given on my email had been and gone.  I contacted Nike online and I was told that they were processing the order and it should be with me in the next couple of days, this was plausible as of this time of year and due to us being in a second lockdown, people were ordering more online.  That date came and gone to.  The order number I had been sent did not work online when trying to track the order, and when I contacted the store, I was told to contact head office.I then contacted Nike by telephone as I thought it would be better to talk to someone rather than messaging someone to explain my situation, I was on the telephone for 30 minutes and again I was told that there had been a delay with the order, and I would receive them by the following week.  I was getting fed up, and Nike had another discount code which I could use against the trainers that my daughter wanted for Christmas, I purchased the trainers again applying the discount code even although I had still not received my original pair.  Again, my new delivery date had come and gone, so I contacted Nike again via online, and again I was told that there had been a problem with the order and it was due to the item being out of stock...which was strange as I had already received the pair that I had ordered the day before without any issues.  I explained this to the customer service advisor and explained that I do not think that I will receive the trainers and would like my money refunded which she was happy to do and I received an email confirming that the order had been cancelled and if there was any refund due, I would receive it.  I am still waiting on a £40+ refund for a pair of trainers I have not received.  This was on the 28th November the refund was put through and it should take 5-7 days for the refund to be returned to my bank account, but I am still waiting...Absolute disgrace and I have lost all faith in a well known company!!!",2020-12-05T19:57:52.000Z,Nike

They told me this would be ok, as long as I sent proof that I had returned the shoes (which I have). So I sent all my proof by email to Nike Assist and then waited for a month or so. Now after phoning them again the idiot on the phone has decided I can’t get a refund as I don’t have an order number. He wouldn’t let me speak to someone else or a manager. So basically they are left to their own devices to be rude and unhelpful. For a billion $ company the service Nike provides is shockingly bad. No one has ever replied to my email. Most Retail  companies reply back within a few days. Nike - get your customer service team sorted and give me my refund!!",2020-12-03T22:05:31.000Z,Nike

I went to the store they told me to call customer service as they would be able to give me a gift receipt. How wrong I was. I was going round and round in circles with them and to top it off management refused to call me back to speak to me themselves!! This is appalling behaviour.

Ruined my entire disposition,__,1,"30677171 Terrible. My order was not placing though and I had a screenshot of the time error message. I spent hours trying to place it through multiple times and as I was calling in the cyber Monday deal expired. they had corrected the 25 percent they said but transferred me to the supervisor to apply an additional inconvenience discount. 'Sebastian' the supervisor was so disrespectful. He would interrupt me and talk over me in his way of trying to get me to shut up before I could explain the issue it seems. He didn't even ask me to explain what was going on. He would manipulatively talk for a long time in an attempt to try to throw me off and make me forget what I was trying to say. I didn't get a full sentence in without being attempted shut down and getting pissed off. I was reading him the error code and he cut me off to pretend like he could not hear it. He concluded that because I was trying to talk over him and his authority and would not be grateful, that therefore he would not give me any discount and would not allow my order to process through, after the previous rep placed it through. that he would hang up in 30 secs. He said to email him proof that I had been trying to place an order hours ago which I would email him once he emailed me. I never got an email. Basically lied to me on the phone and then recorded down something else. The next customer rep said he wrote down in his notes that I would not be allowed to call back after he said that Nike was closing the night before. A way to manipulate me into not being able to be helped. He put down in the notes that there would be no more service regarding this issue. None of the following supervisors would speak to me after calling multiple times. I was squeezed out of being offered any service whenever I called. Basically, he used his authority to silence me and shut me out/down so i wouldn't be able to voice my problems. I don't even know if that's allowed. Had I known I going to be put through this much CRAP I would've never ordered on Nike in the first place and will not again. The customer service supervision is just so upsetting and not acceptable. I am not willing to sign on to any of the brand deals you guys are offering me since then. I don't want anyone else to be treated like that. He was trying to get rid of me, not playing on my team, they clearly had the ability to make my experience better and instead decided to find loopholes to hurt me. I stopped calling because not one person was willing to listen to what I was trying to say, they would say I am not allowed to speak to you anymore before I was allowed to speak at all. I was just trying to buy a nice pair of shoes on Cyber Monday. So much wasted time and energy and In the end nothing was resolved and my corrected order was not even placed through. It just was so upsetting, I'm confused. Is this the company culture that Nike embodies? Disappointing. The service is just so so bad and undermining don't think it's worth the shoes honestly.",2020-12-02T18:02:46.000Z,Nike

This disgusting company has accused me of having fraudulent activity on my account but I know 1000% that I haven't committed any kind of fraudulent activity it's a total lie to try and cover their selves from their mistakes ,i wasting more money on the phone being held in queues to find out what the situation was,untold a number of times that you will receive a manager call back in a set time and it didn't happen, thenI'm finally called back by a manager called Adam who i have spoke to before a number of times he has come to the phone with no information to give me or hasn't spoken to me so another mistake on your part, it doesn't take any idiot to work out if someone is ringing up with an issue and you know of it issue then you need to speak to the irrelevant people before you get back to the customer that is making the complaint, this disgusting company has made me worry now that my account and my credit card details are open to fraud and they will not explain what is going on,and they won't explain what is going on because they know nothing has gone on ,they just want to try and get me off of their system because I have put them in their place and shut them down with every mistake they have made and they don't like it.if you're going to have people on your reception answering phones to the public then they should know the right information to tell them not get annoyed when customers tell you how to run their business and how certain things work. I am 46 and have spent a lot of money over the years on products from Nike and this is the respect I  get. Made up accusations that they don't want to clear up. so how safe is people's details how safe is my credit card information now if they won't explain what has happened. They are crooks ,and by the looks of it your information is not safe either. how can somebody accuse you of something are you but not explain why,would any of you or your staff members like to be accused of a crime that you haven't done and I know the answer is no. All I can do is put every single phone call every single video that I have made on to the internet where everybody can wise up about this company Nike. That seems to lie and cheat their way through and discriminate against the disabled. This is not about the money I have lost this is about the principal and I am going to do everything in my power to shame your company on a daily basis, and seek legal representation around the situation and take this disgusting company to court, for committing fraud against me and for also for defamation of character. You have picked on the wrong little person . and the reason I am more infuriated is because I have done absolutely nothing to be treated in this way.  Amateurs but haven't got a clue what they're doing ,turning people's lives upside down accusing them of criminal activities with no proof whatsoever how dare you. And the crazy thing is I still don't know if my credit card or my address is safe. So people be wise when you're using this company.

More Nike theft,NR Newcastle,1,"As others have said, Nike seem to be stealing money. I made an order with them today. Seconds later, a duplicate order was placed - not by me. However, both amounts of money have been logged on my bank account. I tried to cancel one - can't. I contacted customer services (Jhan) who said ""don't worry, you can return the duplicate then you'll get a refund"". They just didn't get that the money had been taken without authorisation and that it wasn't acceptable practice. Within minutes it was impossible for me or them to cancel an order - this can't be right? How was a duplicate order made without me authorising payment? Something is very wrong with their systems and I won't be shopping with them again. I emailed the Nike address on the paypal receipt only to find out it doesn't exist! Something very wrong indeed with Nike. BEWARE!",2020-11-27T15:47:18.000Z,Nike

Frustrated and disappointed,Nora,1,"Let me start my message with the fact that use Nike for long time, clothes, accessories. And for long years I was totally satisfied and glad to find a reliable manufacturer with high quality.However it recently changed. I feel frustrated, disappointed and don`t see how/when it will be resolved. I bought a Nike Vaporfly 4% running shoes in January. After not even 10 months of using it and having 1000km, the tread started falling apart from the rest of the shoes and it started feeling inconvenient during running. I believe it would be pretty expensive to spend over 230 GBP on yearly basis for a new pair of shoes or if this is Nike's strategy then I made a mistake with the original purchase.After I get in touch with Customer Service Team who advised to return it back to the Store, who will manage inspection and issue a refund. More weeks after the shoes had been delivered to the return address, I didn't receive any update at all. I called the `Store` number where a gentleman asked me to provide evidence of the return regardless I told that the status of the order on Nike website clearly said that has been received by Nike on the 4th November.The gentleman said they will proceed with the refund but nothing happened. I just keep calling them. So far I can't see any update on the website or received anything via email which i was told i will.Since I don`t have a running shoe for 3 weeks, I decided I will give it a try and order another type hoping to have “longer life”. I checked the size details of my previous shoe in cm (Vaporfly) and I ordered a Pegasus 37 in the same size. I received it and that was small regardless of the cm written on the website said the same as the other. I returned this straight afterwards and did a photo again if any evidence will be required for this return too and just hope now that the refund will be processed for that at least on time and will receive update and refund for the vaporfly as well.Other frustration that I couldn't find any contact information where I can send escalation / complaint and ask support.",2020-11-25T20:18:22.000Z,Nike

Customer Service is Terrible,Chris,1,"No really, listen to the recent reviews. Let me be clear, I'm a Nike product fan. Their shoes suit me well and I have some of the gym clothes too. And usually, the quality is top marks.I bought their shoes recently and got them pretty much within a couple of days. Excellent. A short while later, a family member asked me to order them shoes. I did, with the order due to arrive 6 days after. However, it did not turn up and 7 days after that date, it still appears to have not even shipped out yet. I 'chatted' this morning with a rep and they said they'd send the cancellation email but they have not. Second attempt, I got to 5th in the queue and was booted off. I'm now on my third attempt to get into contact with customer service to cancel the shoes. Impressively, it's after closing time and I'm still in the queue. Not sure for how long though!

Good service but poor customer satisfaction,MPCpl,2,"I recently had to return a pair of trainers as they were faulty. The fault was accepted and the return process was really smooth. When I had bought the shoes there was a promo on which meant I got about £30 off, with faulty items they let me know they can only offer a straight refund and not a replacement but this has meant I'm now having to pay the full price to replace a faulty item. They said a price match wasn't available as it was after 30 days, but a fault is a fault and I do no feel the time frame should apply in this instance, I could understand if it was a regular return. I have good faith in Nike hence why I am happy to order the shoe again, but it really shows that the company don't care too much about customer satisfaction or doing the right thing by the customer. I am left feeling disappointed and more cautious of Nike as a company. Very happy to say that all customer service agents were polite, helpful and timely!",2020-11-23T14:45:47.000Z,Nike

Nike no help at all,David Pehrson,1,"On November 10th my credit card was used for an unauthorized purchase for an Apple Watch 500 ish dollars. My credit card company informed me and I did not make this charged. We canceled the card and they removed the charge. I thought that was it. I then received a call from a local fedex trying to find out about a package that had my name on it. They said it was from Nike and that they had several calls to forward the package and attempts to pick it up. I thought that I would DO THE RIGHT THING. I went down and picked up the package so that Nike would not loose this watch. Now is where everything goes down hill. Call 1. I called Nike and explained what had happened and after 20 min on the phone the call was dropped. Call 2 next day I called again and they said thank you for getting this and they sent me a label to take it to the shipping company. I thought I would be done. I went to the fedex drop off and they wanted me to pay to ship the watch back. I told them this was NOT what Nike said. Why would I pay to ship a product I never ordered. I gave them grace it must be a mistake. Call 3 same thing for another 30 min of my life. The lady assured me it was good to go. I printed off the second label and took it this time to UPS. Same thing is I pay them to ship it back. Now I am PISSED OFF. I spent the last 3 days trying to do the right thing and all I get is same results. I call back from the ups store thinking again it’s a mistake and go through another 40 min call. He said the system needed an hour to generate a shipping label. It is now 12 hours and no shipping label. Nike customer service people were all very nice but I still have a package that I never ordered. With all the time, effort and frustration I am done with tying to get this watch back to you.

I also hear that some drivers don't ring people's bells so the package can be delivered if they have a lot of routes to do so they leave notices which is so unfair.

Contacted Nike today by using their Consumer Services Chat to be told that the order is 'stuck' in one of their warehouses and I can cancel the order for a refund and then reorder, I asked if the trainers were out of stock and if this could be the reason for delay, trainers are still in stock but just stuck, if I reorder them they would be sent to the right warehouse, or I could wait to see if there is any movement within the next couple of days. I am not at all satisfied with this response, when I mentioned that I do not understand how this order is stuck and can not be sent on to another warehouse, I received a crap response of 'let me make this more clearer'. Why should I have to go through the process of requesting a refund, waiting for this to be received and then having to reorder and the item then possibly being out of stock in the size required when the item is in stock!.

Talked to 3 different people over the chat on their website and all said the refund was issued and would arrive on my account within a few days. Still no refund. Asked to transfer me to their supervisor — apparently, there are no available supervisors according to customer service...Overall, I have to say that besides being defected, the shoes did not feel or look like anything more impressive than a cheaply made pair from a Chinese market. I had to go to Adidas and buy myself a new pair because I simply didn't have any patience left to deal with Nike... and you know what? Those Adidas shoes are the best training shoes I've ever bought.

Do not buy- White & Grey Air Vapormax Flyknit 3 Sneakers,MD,1,"I am extremely disappointed in these shoes. They cost $250 and my son wore them for less than 3 months and the bubbles at the bottom are all broken.  The top of the shoes is light white and grey colour so still in mint condition but the bottoms are all wrecked. I can support my review with documents to prove this is a genuine review. My son’s shoe size is 12. He is 16 years old. We purchased these shoes in December before his ACL surgery on Feb 18, 2020.  In March, we were in COVID lock down. He is still recovering from his surgery and he is not cleared for any sports or intense physical activity. Needless to say he did not have the opportunity to wear his shoes very much. But the bubbles are damaged and in one of the bubbles a rock was stuck. I wish I could attach a photo to show you this.  So I had to spend another 250, this time I bought him adidas shoes (no bubbles) as he has to have good support when he steps. He cannot step on deflated bubbles. I will try to take them to a shoe maker as the top is still brand new, but this may be challenging to fix due to bubbles. Very disappointed, for something that is this expensive. They definitely lost 4 customers, because as long as I am paying no NIKE shoes. Also they are impossible to reach, so I came across this website to leave a review.",2020-10-11T17:39:44.000Z,Nike

Its because usually i’m quite forgiving especially when they express regret for the customer receiving a poor experience. But with my recent two online shopping experiences with nike, i was so flabbergasted that not only did they screw up my order once but on the second order they promised to price match and they didnt process the rebate. When questioned the response was that there will be no refund (even though I saved a copy of the service consultant promising the price match). After that they basically said if I wasnt happy I could return the shoes for a refund less the international transaction fees paid and likely the credit card charges i will incur. When i asked to speak to supervisor, I was told they would call me back when the supervisor was free. Its been a week....Update 23 Nov:Still no call from supervisor... they now understand they do need to give me a refund, but still no refund in sight.... its been 2 months and endless promises of a refund and still no cash",2020-10-07T09:57:45.000Z,Nike

After a while, I picked three different pairs to narrow down since I figured the shoes I wanted were never gonna come back in stock. Today I realised that all the pairs I picked only had SIZE 18 AVAILABLE. I contacted costumer service to ask them when the shoes are going to be restocked since I start in-person school in a week and a half and need new shoes and their response was ""I don't know, you should favorite them so you can check to see if they restocked your size"" LIKE DUDE IVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SEVEN MONTHS. and I told them that and they responded with ""hope you get them!"" like............. wth. terrible",2020-09-30T17:23:18.000Z,Nike

Disgustingly rude staff - terrible internal processes,Matthew,1,"I have been a loyal Nike member since 2013 and ordered many of times over the years. I placed an order on the 31st August 2020 for a pair of trainers, which I paid with a gift voucher and applied a 25% promo at the time. 8th September I received an email to notify of delay in order due to stock. After speaking to several people, asking when it would be dispatched, they offered an extra 15% off as a gesture. (Acceptable at the time) however to this day it was still stuck 'In progress' when they had already put stock back on their website. 1 agent said they would email the warehouse to process the order quickly. Another agent told me they couldn't email the warehouse? I was also told that delayed orders are prioritised over new orders, but then another agent stated from their experience, cancelling the order and reordering again would be quicker!? I asked if a manager could call me to discuss the issue, as I cannot believe in 2020 no one can simply put a call/email into the warehouse to speed up a delivery which has been delayed significantly. Never received a call after being promised someone would call me on either the Saturday or Monday just gone. No emails received either. I then decided to call today to simply cancel the order and reorder, to my annoyance that I was told that they cannot honour the 25% promo code again but would have to reimburse, once Ive paid full price!? The worst part of this experience which topped it for me, I spoke to Ryan today, who in all my years of interaction with a customer service rep, have I spoke to someone who is so rude and confrontational. I was gobsmacked by his tone of voice, which was aggressive and he assumed upon previous notes, (He was very quick to tell me notes his colleague left). I am still shocked by the way he spoke to me. He is based in Dublin/Ireland where most of their customer service is. I have now cancelled and left short of order. - Goes well if stocks in place but if something delays, be prepared for a nightmare. If you want Nike products i would go via 3rd Parties and not direct because their clearly is no consequence for staff who act inappropriately.",2020-09-25T09:13:47.000Z,Nike

First chat, ernie, simply couldnt do anything since it was not processed. Ok. 2nd chat, Mary, just left me hanging after asking for my details. Fine. The 3rd and most horrible one, Troy, immediately just gave me a stern reply of ""NO"" and scolded me for not reading their ""30min rule"".

30 minutes to cancel or change size!  Can you believe this?,Alex,1,"Before you go ahead and buy anything from Nike.com, you should know that you have ""30 minutes"" only to cancel or change size. So by any chance (like me) if you order the wrong size the customer service will tell you ""sorry we can't do anything"".. I literally contacted them to cancel my order or allow me to change the size 1 hour after my order online and what they told me was mind blowing. You can't!.. You have to wait to receive order then go through post office to return to them! Then only you get your refund. This is the most ridiculous rule i have ever seen. They even suggest me to refuse to accept the parcel. I mean what kind of idiotic company have such moronic policy in this era. Every online shop do their best to make customers happy. I am extremely disappointed and will never ever buy directly from NIKE. They simply do no give a ""Damn"" about customers.

Worst experience ever.,Adrian D,1,"Worst experience ever.I have bought a pair of Nike Wildhorse-6 on 28 Jul 2020 with 60 euros at a promotion, with an estimated time of delivery between 02 August and 09 August. On 6 of August, I have asked information from support to see what happened to it, and they said that the package didn't leave the warehouse and provided a tracking number with the promise to ship the package the immediately. On 09 August the package was still not shipped and went to ask info again. They said that they will investigate and that I will receive a response on the email in 3 days max. On 12 of August I have not received any response and went back to support where they told me that in another 3 days max I will receive an answer. On 15th of August I haven't received any response and went again to support where they told me that there was a problem with the order, and they cannot ship it. However, I have the option to have the money refunded and to order again, but at a price of 120 euros, as the promotion was not active anymore. I told them that if I can order again the pair, it means that the shoes are available in the warehouse, and they can send the original order. They said that they cannot do that and I have then asked for a manager to provide me with an official answer that they cannot send me the shoes that I bought with a price due to an issue on the warehouse, but they can send the same pair if I pay double the price. The manager told me that she will refund the first order, I need to order again and to pay the full price while she will match the price and refund the difference. She even gave me a case number for reference. I agreed, and I have received the package 28 of August and the first refund on 30 August. I have waited for the second refund until today, 8 September but after no sign of getting the money I have contacted the support. The agent told me that they had an issue in their program and the refund was not performed. Well, isn't there a person who verifies if things are done at the end of the day? It appears not and I have again asked for a manager to inform me what would happen if I didn't contact them to ask about the refund. The agent said that the manager is not available, and they promised that I will receive a proof of the refund and a statement on the email in 3 days.

I've call 3 times about a purchase I never made and it is clear as freakin day that it was sent to a different location from were i have been living for 14yrs. Your company policy states it was an authentic order and if i want my money back I have to return the product. How can I return a product I never received nor did I order to know what it was to even return. You know who ordered the product why not charge them? go after them? since they technically didn't pay for YOUR products and just return the money that is mine that your customer used to fraudulently pay for your products. It's blatantly clear this company runs on absolute greed and fraud and doesn't care about actual justifiable facts.

Their product was faulty and now I m chasing daily to get my money back. £97 isn’t nothing !!!! I guess they’re hoping I give up but I won’t.

Faulty app and poor customer service. Cancelled order without notifying me.,Katie Warrener,1,"Absolute nightmare ! Made two orders via the app- first one had errors and ended up ordering me the wrong size (due to stock restraints). Fortunately I noticed straight away and cancelled the order. Next order Nike cancelled and didn’t notify me. Only realised when I went to check on the delivery status a few days later. After a struggle getting through via there chat I was informed that it was to do with which capitals I used in my address and advised to call my bank to check the capitals match: just wasting my time. Anyway, missed out on their 25% offer because they cancelled my order and they basically just said ‘tough’. On top of that, now the trainers are out of stock so can’t order them anyway.",2020-09-03T10:47:15.000Z,Nike
Excellent exchange service.,Matthew,5,"Excellent service. Ordered numerous items in the 25% off sale. Love all the items but one of the printed logos was printed incorrectly. Very minor mistake but a mistake non the less. I rang Nike to make an exchange and the item was selling very quickly with only my size left. They reserved a pair for me as I was concerned by the time they received the item back it would be out of stock. Returned item on the Wednesday using their free Royal Mail returns. It arrived at Nike on Thursday and I had my replacement pair on Friday less than 48 hours later. Fantastic service, thank you.",2020-09-02T10:41:31.000Z,Nike

"sent the wrong item, took 28 days to resolve",Frances,1,"i bought a pair of shoes over a month ago from nike - they sent me the wrong item. fast forward 28 days and i've been arguing with them for a resolution as they'd just been telling it's with the ""higher ups"" and to hang on to the shoes for a exchange. they finally told me today that the shoes i wanted were never in stock, i noticed they'd changed the photo on the listing too to the shoes i got, rather than the ones i wanted. i dont know why they couldn't have told me a month ago they weren't in stock. however they also didn't offer me to exchange to a similar pair - i ordered the shoes in women's but they also had them in unisex and never mentioned this as a resolution. in the end they told me i could have 10% off (told they i wouldnt be using it lol). I looked at the unisex version that was £7 more expensive, so even with the code i'd still be spending more than i did on the shoes that were never in stock? and now i have to wait 8-14 days for a refund.TL;DRordered shoes that turned out were out of stock, took them 28 days to tell me and only because i kept nagging, now having to return them. was given 10% good will discount to spend on their website. basically the same shoes i didnt get are £7 more expensive than the ones i ordered.",2020-09-01T08:04:32.000Z,Nike

Never Again........Ever,Mandy “Mando” Ellis,1,"My husband bought me the new Liverpool kit as a belated birthday present. I ordered on 6th August and was given a delivery date of 13th August which was fair as I was getting it personalised. At nearly lunchtime on 13th I received an email to tell me it had been delayed, no other information as to when it would be expected,just delayed. I got in touch via chat and asked for it to be cancelled,said they couldn't cancel it because it was been processed. A week later, got in touch again as no sign of it? please be patient as it's one step away from being despatched which told me it was ready and would soon be with me.....WRONG!!Another week later, online chat AGAIN, oh we're sorry we're still waiting for stock of some of the components for your shirt, so I was lied to and it wasn't ready to be shipped at all. Last week I again asked for it to be cancelled,lovely lady who said she would add me to the list of cancellation requests, yesterday I asked if it had definitely been cancelled and when should I expect my refund so I can purchase from elsewhere, told the money isn't taken until item despatched it's just held in authorisation and to expect it in my available funds within 5-12 days....fair enough, asking again if it's definitely been cancelled and no response!!The whole time it's been sat in my orders and it's progress has been listed as 'Unknown' I still don't know if it's actually been cancelled, so frustrating.

Slow refund process,Ordinarydude,2,So I returned my trainers early August and was told the refund had been put through.  2 weeks later no sign of it and they said it hadn’t gone through (although no-one got in touch to tell me this).  It’s dubious to say the least as no retailer has had an issue refunding to my credit card before.  They told me someone would be in touch to take my payment details.  I waited a week and nothing.  So phoned again and made a fuss and someone called me about 2 hours later.  They took my bank account details for some reason.  A week later it’s still not appeared so will give it a few more days and then phone again..All the customer service staff have been polite but it seems that they quietly operate a system where they actively avoid giving refunds to customers in the hope that they’ll give up and walk away (I won’t!).Very poor.,2020-08-27T08:41:30.000Z,Nike

I have now called Nike customer service on 6 separate occasions, they have asked me to email them a copy of my bank statement then claimed not to receive it, I have also had 2 online chat conversations with them. Each time they say they will 'escalate' my case and someone will be in touch and then never are, it is now over a month since I should have received my refund and nothing. The amount is close to £100. Some of the customer service team have been very rude and aggressive, others have been nice, helpful and apologetic but then been cut off on several occasions and not called back. I have now wasted hours on this and there is still no sign of my money?! Will never be purchasing from Nike again which is a shame because I love the products.

Worst experience I've ever had with a…,Bing Chen,1,"Worst experience I've ever had with a retailer. I'm a Nike plus member and they sent me a special members-only promotion where if I purchase 150+ on an order, I would receive a $75 off promo code for a future purchase. So I made an order. When I received the order, I needed to exchange an item for a different size but they were having server issues and could only do the exchange as a refund + buy separately. I asked if doing that would affect my promotion eligibility, MULTIPLE people assured me it would not. One of them even asked a supervisor and said I was still eligible. The day I was supposed to receive the promo code, I didn't get it. I called them and they gave me a time frame to receive the code, saying X date would be the last day they send out the codes. It gets closer to the deadline and I call again, they tell me to wait until the X date, saying if I don't receive it till then, I should give them a call. Then it passed the deadline and I didn't get my code, so I called and they start telling me the X date was actually the last day to USE the code (contradicting the previous statements saying the X date was the last day to receive the code). After talking with a few more people, eventually their excuse became: only a select random number of people who participated in the promotion would get the code, and I just wasn't selected. This last part really got me, because that was not AT ALL what the initial invite said, nor was it in the fine print. At this point, this whole experience felt like some sort of promotion scam and I've pretty much just been lied to for about a whole month. If they had just told me from the start I wasn't getting the promo code, I wouldn't have wasted so much time and money on them. So I guess the lesson here is, next time I see some too-good-to-be-true promotion in my email inbox, I should just send it straight to the trash.",2020-08-23T23:54:51.000Z,Nike

The PL is rife with corruption and greed and favoritism. An historic and loyal football club are being treat with complete disregard, and furthermore, so are the fans and the people who live in the city the club represents. A takeover was set to happen, after 13 years of ownership by a man who only wanted profit without spending, by a consortium that were happy and willing to invest not only in the club, but the region. This region will be hit the hardest economically after the current pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of hard working people are already at risk of burn out just trying to make ends meet and it is only going to get worse. The proposed investment would have meant massive progress for the economy, but also jobs, housing and schools for the people who live here. The same people who buy and wear Nike products. As sponsors of the PL, you have a duty to your loyal consumers to also hold the PL to account. And you are not. You, just as the other sponsors, are sitting by idly, while real people are suffering, and will continue to suffer. We all work hard in this region, but we cannot continue to LIVE without some help or opportunity that is NEVER given up here. That opportunity has been snatched away because of the PL and their favoured teams. It becomes more and more obvious with every day of silence and ignorance, that the PL and their 'Big 6' and their other 'friends' (namely Qatar and beIN Sports - who reportedly fund terrorist organisations) are afraid of fair competition in sport. It seems to us, as Nike are also saying and doing nothing, that you are okay with this. As a sports brand, do you think it acceptable to endorse unfair competition and unsportsmanship? Is that the image you want to gain? Because that is the image you are giving to the fan base - on a global level. There are fans of that club all over the world. And fans all over the world are becoming just as digusted with the sponsors, as they are with the PL. As such, I, and many others that I have spoken to, cannot and will not continue to give Nike or the other sponsors our hard earned money, when they clearly do not care about their consumers. It is unfair and unjust and Nike are guilty by association in their continued support of the PL and their utter contempt for Newcastle United, the fans and the people who live in the city. Shame on all of you. I hope all your money brings you comfort when you remember what you have done to an entire community. I hope, that your money makes you feel human. Because the way we are being treated is inhumane and incredibly classist. Disgrace.",2020-08-11T20:14:04.000Z,Nike

Poor Quality and Customer Service,Tracy King,1,I purchased a pair of shoes and wore them for less than 2 months when they started getting a hole in the top. I'm not a runner so they don't get abused.

How can a show start to fall apart after less than two months?! I'll never purchase another product from Nike. They lost a LONG time customer.

I contacted them right away to cancel the order and was told the shoes will probably still ship to me and I'll have to ship them back for a refund. That means for almost a month they want to keep money and they want me to take my time to ship the shoes back to them. They didn't take the time to inform me of a backordered or out of stock issue untill the day the shoes should be here, and then tell me they won't ship for days, but can't stop my order? NIKE IS A JOKE!

They didn't have the womens size available so I oredered the mens ones as it really doesn't bother me. I decided because they were mens I would order a size down but upon trying them on I realized I'd made a mistake and I should of gone with my normal size. I jumped on a live chat with someone and they said that I would need to print an exchange label but due to Covid-19 I was unable to do this as I don't have my own printer SO, they told me to use my returns label and get proof of postage, send them the reference number and that they would trigger the exchange manually from their end. Got home, did all mentioned above and within 5 days I had my new shoes in the correct size.Staff were friendly, helpful and speedy so definitely no complaints.I also made sure to complete the Nike survey with the names of the two employees that helped me as I thought they did such a great job.",2020-07-08T21:17:30.000Z,Nike
Deleting account,Nathan,1,Just about had it with Nike's shi**y service. Ordered a running vest I really wanted in my normal size. It was slightly too big. I therefore ordered a medium and sent this one back. 5 days later Nike sent me an email saying they can't fulfill the order because they are out of stock. What shocking stock control. I must have spent over 1k on there in the last 2 months. I'm just going to delete my account. They are honestly a terrible company to deal with...and you're paying a premium for this.,2020-07-08T19:00:23.000Z,Nike

The best sportswear brand in my humble opinion,Neil Hay,5,I shop online with Nike.com frequently. I am impressed with their frequent shipping updates and easy and free returns. Your shopping history is all captured on the Nike.com app as well.

Awful experience - avoid at all costs or face being in lengthy battles to get refunds.,Stephen,1,I have had both great service and absolutely shocking service from Nike. I am currently locked in a Paypal dispute with them for an item I returned in May that has still to be refunded to my account. Nike claim to have refunded this amount but a check of their Paypal would see that they have not. Unbelievable one of the biggest sports companies and having to fight to get a refund from them. I would avoid buying from this company - I have been on Live Chat with them 3 times and been told i have been refunded but the refund still hast appeared. Will stick to other Sports Brands in future or at least buy from a JD or somewhere with proper customer service. As part of the Paypal review they then sent me a Chinese company address to return the item to - even though I had sent it back to them months previously.As an update I won the Paypal dispute and am being refunded but this is August and I returned the item in May - will never use this service again!! At least Paypal could see the disgusting treatment anyway and they have had to pay me - small vindication against them.,2020-07-06T08:28:18.000Z,Nike

George Preston Marshall was racist against blacks, but the Redskins name was actually in honor of the current coach William ""Lone Star"" Dietz.

Nike,Senpai,2,Nike. Why order from Nike when you have retailers in your area that sells basically the same items. Simple: They may be out of stock or not have the items your looking for. This shouldnt be a problem with Nike. Oh boy was I wrong. I wanted to order Nike space hippies but they got sold out. I tried searching for them at the Nike site or sneaker app but nothing comes up.

I did live chat 4 times (cut off / asked for more info / waiting for an emails response that never arrives...) then I tried the phone (cut off / asked for more info / waiting fro email that never arrive).

"Not loving the customcare, but the shoe!",Elisabet,1,"I love the running shoe ""lunarglide 9"". Every search for a month now, show ""sold out"". I go to nikes homepage, thinking if they do not have the shoe, then at least they could give me some information about it. They do not have the shoe, and there is no possibility of sending them en email for a question. There is a phonenumber, but only in english(I live in Sweden). I try to call them anyway. A man answers with a natural ""hello"", so I start to speak and then I realize that an automatic voice starts to disrupt me. It is a recorded message! Then I need to listen to choices, told by 4 different automatic womens and mens voices. Then the same different voices starts to apologizing for being buzzy, constantly. I held out for 5 minutes and had to hang up because the voices were just to annoying, which is probably the idea. Nike states that they want to be an inovating company and support the community. I had a 5 min. encounter and wanted to run the other way. At least they inspired me to running! A company of this really bad customcare I have seldom spotted. Also, I presume, they have cancelled a most beloved and sought after product. Very inovating, indeed. Well, I just have to wear out my current lunarglide and then search out another company for great running shoes, because a company with such bad customcare, do not deserve any customers.",2020-06-30T13:59:56.000Z,Nike

The return process was a nightmare as I went to their website, selected DPD pickup, they gave me a date, the courier came another day, couldn’t recognise the label, then Nike told me they don’t use DPD for returns. Really? With the refund, I’ve placed another order expected for today. The confirmation email arrived 3 days later. Because of the delay they caused, an item went out of stock and they cancelled it. They lost the other item, promised a refund that didn’t arrive. Their customer service number doesn’t work and the chat one is useless. As result, I’ve lost my money, got no item and no refund.

I am 25 years old, I know how to code and I place online orders on a regular basis. I never have a problem. You are clearly the problem. How hard is it to get 2 pairs of shorts and a pair of slides?

I normally don't write bad reviews, but my experience with the Legend React Running shoes (that I was TOLD) were great for running, was horrible. Nike does NOT stand by their products quality!After maybe 3 months of running, the material at back of shoes was GONE. I had blisters and couldn't run in them. I sent them into the company, which meant I also had to pay for shipping, just to get a response of ""oh, it's normal wear and tear."" I called in again to express that this isn't normal wear and tear and I've had running shoes before doing the same amount of running and that weren't $140 and never had this issue. They said ""send them in again, pay for the shipping, and we 'may' reverse our answer."" Needless to say I'm just throwing the shoes out!!! This is a company that doesn't stand by it's quality! I purchased a pair of BOSE headphones, the left ear piece stopped having sound, I called the company and with no questions, they send me a PAID shipping label and sent me brand new headphones in three weeks.

Awful service / delivery time,Dickie Bird,1,"Ordered custom nikes on 5th May, which had an original delivery date of June 4th.

Almost a month and still no delivery!,Lisa Mckinnell,1,"Ok so I placed an order for trainers for my sons birthday on the 21st of may. I was told they would be delivered on the 2nd of June, which was the day before his birthday. They didn’t arrive and I had no contact regarding delivery. So my son was missing an expensive birthday present. I called on the 3rd of June to be told they were held up in the warehouse and had not been sent yet. I was also told they would be put on priority as a delayed order and should be sent out within couple of days. Today is another week later and I’ve just called again to be told they still have not been sent. The call handler mentioned that I would be compensated for this order once I’ve received it but I’m unsure as to how this will be done. Annoyed is an understatement and I’m definitely put off shopping with Nike in the future.",2020-06-11T10:43:01.000Z,Nike

Takes forever and doesn't update you at all,Pao,1,"I don't understand why a million dollar company has such a terrible delivery service. Every other store gives you your order status with where your order is at. Nike says nothing except that they have been ordered and will come within a week or the next month. I have been waiting for weeks and haven't received anything. Shipping over 100$ should be free if the service is this trash.

Poor service from Nike,Christopher,2,"My wife ordered a Barcelona shirt and shorts for our grandsons birthday, the shorts arrived and then we received an Email stating that the shirt we had ordered had for some unknown reason been returned and we received a refund. We had no knowledge why the shirt had been returned and when we contacted Nike, we were told they could not tell us why the shirt had been returned. We explained that we had not cancelled the order and now we had missed our grandsons birthday. We were told that we just had to re-order and although the person on the chat link expressed some regret was unable to to put us through to someone who could take our complaint of very poor service any further. I understand that mistakes happen but there was no process where the problem could just be resolved by sending out a new shirt.  It took some time just to get the assistant to take some personal responsibility for the problem but we would still have to re purchase the product.  For a world wide company the whole thing has left me feeling undervalued, and I certainly wouldn’t recommend Nike to anyone else in the future.",2020-06-10T16:14:37.000Z,Nike

Eventually, I telephoned them and they said there was an issue with my billing address so they cancelled. Never ever had this with any other supplier. It is an excuse and as someone else said there is a problem if the company cannot inform a customer that they have cancelled. I recommend never using this company ever again.

I contacted them 5 times they said we're looking into it we will contact you. They said it was down to my billing address being wrong its out of stock which i already knew that i should try to contact my bank or make another purchase to check.

Non-existent Customer Service,Beata,2,"I have ordered shoes online. I'm willing to give two stars, because the online order process itself was super easy, and obviously not complicated. Also delivery was quick, only 6 days within Europe. However, the shoes (white Air Max 720) were delivered with brownish stains all over them. Customer service hotline not responsive, and I have been waiting for 37 minutes to speak to someone. Didn't happen in the end. No possibility to contact them via mail, so this is a major minus in Customer Care service.

Great Quality Shoes and Fast Delivery,Abdullah Shaikh,5,"I ordered a pair of Nike air max 720-818 and Nike air max 200 on 29th may 2020 online. At this time there was a promotional offer for 30% off everything on the store so without hesitating I bought the shoes. When I ordered I waited a bit for them to send confirmation email but it hadn't come but after 4 hours after purchasing online I got the email saying my order has been confirmed.After on the order status it showed processing order and I was thinking when they will dispatch the order (they had given me an estimated delivery time of 11 June) so I waited and yesterday I got en email they had dispatched my order.The delivery took less than 24 hours to arrive by DPD. I received the shoes this morning. So it took 7 days to come which Is reasonable and during this pandemic they had to be more careful so I didn't mind it taking long to arrive.The delivery takes 1 day after they had dispatched the item and an average of 5-6 days to process your order.The shoes are packed in it's original box with another DPD box on top so they are careful on not to damage the packaging and the shoes. They come with a free return label sticker if you want to return the shoes.The quality of the shoes feels amazing and they fit to size. Sleek, comfy and very well made. I have multiple Air Maxes and even own two pairs of the recent 720s but this pair of 720-818 is by far the nicest air maxes I ever owned. Very stylish and comfy. Looks good with almost anything. I went with the black ones and pictures does not do this shoe justice. Good job Nike for designing and creating some of the most innovative shoes on the market. I will continue supporting and wearing as long as you continue making shoes that accommodates the consumers. The shoes and the picture look identical to each other so you recieve what you buy. First off, they're absurdly comfortable. By far the most cushioning of any sneaker I've ever tried, you really sink in with every step. I think it's great but I could see it being TOO much for some people. Still, if you're looking for the ultimate in cushion, here it is. Second, the materials are really nice. The suede is soft, the leather is pretty nice and the mesh panels feel durable. The cork insole is also a nice touch and helps up the comfort. These feel like they'll hold up to a lot of wears and should still look good a little beat up. The color is also nice, muted earth tones contrast nicely with the over-the-top physical design of the show, it definitely makes the shoe feel more wearable. Fit is true to size, but on the roomier side. Overall two thumbs up.I have no idea why the other reviews are really bad, In my opinion the processing is not the fastest (Adidas delivered in 2 days (Including processing time and dispatching)) but the shoes and the packaging is on point and delivery is very fast. I will definitely order again from this site. I ordered 2 shoes to see if they will loose on of them but they did not. Both shoes were delivered by DPD but not together they both had different tracking numbers and boxes.Message to NIKE: Can you send me more discount code or good offers.",2020-06-05T10:21:12.000Z,Nike

Discusting service from one of the so…,Scott,1,"Discusting service from one of the so called biggest companies in the world. Ordered an item 5 days ago today. Still no word of it being processed at least, let alone dispatched. Long waits on phone to speak to someone. Rang 3 times and its like they read from a script. Cannot answer when challenged on what they say. Asked to cancel my order as it has not even been processed yet. Was told they cannot, I will have to wait until the item comes then return it. Pathetic customer service. Make no attempt to help you or sort the problem out. If you want to get messed about and wait for an obscene amount of time for items you have spent your money on, shop here. If not avoid them. I will never, ever again buy from here.

Ordered never arrived!,Robyn Court,1,"Ordered never arrived!Desperately needed running trainers, ordered on 10th May. Email receipt advised delivery was expected on 28th May. A ridiculous amount of time to wait even in the current circumstances. Website never explained that the delivery time could be 2 and a half weeks. Order had been placed so I decided to go with it - my worst decision. 28th May came and no trainers. I waited until 1st June and decided to call customer services. Michael answered my call, I was put on hold a lot of times. Although I could tell Michael was trying to help, he didn't seem confident on the phone and he didn't even seem certain in the responses he was giving me. I had to constantly ask him to relay what he was trying to say. Michael had problems with his mic with a horrible piercing noise coming through the phone. Michael eventually advised that it was likely my trainers were lost in transit and therefore he would process a refund for me. I explained that I had waited 3 weeks for trainers that were never going to arrive. 3 weeks of no exercise as my current trainers had broken. I explained how annoyed i was. Michael didn't have much to say but he offered me a discount code. I explained I wouldn't be shopping with Nike again and I requested details in order to make a complaint. Michael said that this was not possible, only he could pass on my dissatisfaction. What a bizarre process. Funnily enough only Nike staff can make direct complaints about Nike services. Obviously something isn't right there and statistics of their customer service must be manipulated.

Would give 0 stars if possible,Dominique ,1,"Would give 0 stars if possible. I am absolutely furious at the customer service I have received. All I wanted was a simple exchange as the shoes I ordered didn't fit right so I wanted a different size. The first time I called I was told that was ok, they will process the exchange after I return my shoes, I was told I will receive a free returns label in the post. This never came. I called a second time - apparently the exchange had never actually been processed and that they don't actually send free labels in the post. I was then told return the shoes I have with the returns label already provided and they will send me the new pair. This never happened. So I call a THIRD time and after being on the phone for well over an hour, get told since I returned them and have been refunded I can no longer get the exchange. I am fuming. Out of 'goodwill' Nike gave me a 20% discount code which when I entered it still works out to me paying more for the shoes than what I originally paid so what was the point? Hugely disappointing as this is the first time Ive ever ordered from Nike and to receive this terrible customer service where 2 of their workers clearly don't know how to process an exchange...its so frustrating.

Received no dispatch email so contacted them via the live chat about 2 weeks ago where I was told the items were waiting for dispatch. It's now 30/05 and still no updates. I could only get into contact with the company today via the live chat as the customer service number was unavailable, only for them to tell me that they can only offer me a refund and that the issue is ""already being handled by a higher department"". It seems they never had the items in stock as they aren't even on the website anymore. They have had my money for a month and a half and only after I've followed this up have they offered me a refund. I'm sure if I said nothing they would've just kept the money too.

Nike Air Max 360 worst shoe ever for…,Nolan ,1,"Nike Air Max 360 worst shoe ever for the longest time sense the late 90’s. This is all I would wear is Air Max. Now they are the worse shoe ever have 3 pair currently and all 3 pairs have lost air in them, either the front toe side cushion or the heal cushion. Nike has such poor product right now. Have sent two pairs back to get two new pairs and same thing. Total waste of time and money. Buy On Cloud if you need a running shoe!! Will not buy Nikes for anyone in this household of 7. This is all the kids and wife used to wear including all sport cleats soccer, football and softball. Always something coming apart or falling apart with in the month. Everyone in this family is very particular about there shoes so they are well taken care of, as we will all flip out if someone is stepping or stepped on our shoes, making sure that all our shoes look new for the longest time. So it’s definitely not from being used or worn out. Kids now wear On Cloud along with the rest of the family and for the sports they are all wearing Addidas or Muzuno. Very disappointed in Nike you can totally see their product go down hill after the Air Max in 97,  Nike Mercurial Tempe 2 2015, and Nike Sharks up to 99. 20 years of product that just keeps getting worse.This also includes the clothing can not tell you how many times kids are taking something back to the store cause the stitching is not right or not straight, or wrong size when it says it’s supposed to be a certain size. Check the On Cloud clothing as well the kids love them also.Once a longtime customer!!!",2020-05-25T00:31:22.000Z,Nike

Delivery to be made on the 20/05/2020. Fair enough, 2 days later payment is taken from my account for the vests then next day for the hat then next day for the shoes. I made 1 order, was surprised to see different amounts the I didn’t recognise leaving my account. Soon realised that Nike was taking the money for what had been dispatched. Waiting for my parcel today, apparently it was delivered a couple of days ago by DPD. They put the parcel down by the security gate when they buzzed to come in. Took a picture and left. I didn’t know it was my parcel and normally the delivery’s drivers / post men all come up stairs to take a picture of delivered parcels. The parcels have gone missing and the Nike website still says due for delivery today. There’s is no email for Nike missed parcels, you can only call up and they don’t have 24 hour customer service so you have to call up between 9-5 when most are working. Really disappointed with Nike as they are normally really good with customer care but I feel like it has dropped the ball partly due to Covid-19 but that doesn’t mean it’s okay. Hopefully I can get a refund because I don’t feel comfortbale spending money with Nike again!UPDATE - currently on the phone to Nike... well, waiting to be connected for the last 35 mins.UPDATE - We are now in June and Nike has had no contact with me.

I have a very upsetting experience with…,Hanna Fomchanka,1,"I have a very upsetting experience with Nike.com purchase. Unfortunately, I have decided to place an order with official Nike website for running shoes on May 8th, 2020. My old running shoes got broken and I needed to replace them urgently in order to keep running and stay healthy while in lockdown. I did not realise that orders with Nike.com take at least 3 weeks to be delivered. Once I saw my delivery date, I have decided to cancel the order and purchase the shoes somewhere else. When I called Nike support in the UK, they have told me that they will place a request to warehouse to not dispatch my order and within 3 days I will receive an e-mail either confirming or refusing the request. If I receive refusal, I have to call back. For the starters, I did not receive any e-mail. In a week time, I called back. Please note every call takes at least 1 hour wait to reach any representative of the support team. Once I reached Nike UK support team again, they said that there was a refusal from warehouse, however I did not receive any e-mail. So, I was requested to wait until my order is dispatched and then call again to try to cancel it. I did exactly as support team advised. I have received today an e-mail that my order was dispatched and I called support team for the 3rd time to cancel the delivery. Today, the support representative told me that there is only 50% chance that the cancellation will be successful and that more likely I will receive the shoes and will have to mail them back in order to receive my refund. This is so poorly manged in my opinion, especially taking into consideration that  I have received my new Adidas running shoes within 3 days and have been using them all this time wile Nike is struggling to simply cancel my order for all these days and on top of everything Nike put me in the position that I have to go to mail their product back in the conditions of lockdown.",2020-05-19T12:33:00.000Z,Nike

Later that day I suddenly got an email that they had cancelled my order. Reason was not mentioned. Over a month later, I still haven't received my money back. I tried calling their customer service, no succes: I stayed on hold for 3 hours before the call got ended automatically. A few days later I sent them an email. Two weeks later, still no response.

Most shambolic company ever!,Ignas,1,"I made an order with Nike on 10th April for some shoes I needed because my old ones were all mashed up, I waited for over a month for my order to arrive and only TODAY did I get an email saying my order is cancelled because they’re out of stock 36 days later!!!!! Total waste of my time. Furthermore I went to check on the Nike website and I saw the shoes that they said were “out of stock” were still available. Can’t believe a company I liked so much such as Nike could be so useless. I’m actively going to avoid Nike products as the company uses modern slavery to make their goods and treats their customers disgracefully. I hope the company goes bust!",2020-05-16T10:26:46.000Z,Nike
Worst experience of my life,Alex Ng,1,"I have never written a bad review of any companies, but today, I am utterly disappointed. This customer service is the worst customer service I have encountered in a lifetime. So, here's the story. My Nike Adapt BB is not working, and I have been trying everything I could to make it work. It didn't. Therefore, I contacted Nike Customer Service. I waited 45 minutes and finally, someone answered my message, he provided no solution, and he asked me to call the Nike Customer service. I did, after waiting for 1.5 hours, someone finally responded. He hasn't only repeated what the first staff had told me; he even teased that my shoes might not be an authentic one. After this experience, I would rather have Adidas than having a company that requires their customer to wait more than 2 hours yet could not solve their problem but calling their shoes fake. Outrageous.",2020-05-16T01:14:09.000Z,Nike

Awful customer experience,Martin Dunk,1,Awful experience from the point that I made my order. I placed an order for a pair of trail running shoes nearly 2 months ago paying for express delivery (5days). This date came an passed so I contacted Nike who explained due to COVID delivery times had extended. I fully understood this and was refunded my express delivery fee. 2 weeks later I have still not heard anything from Nike for my delivery details so I sit in the queue to talk with an online advisor and I’m told the shoes have not left the warehouse and there is no expected delivery date due to COVID. I’m starting to feel they are using this as an excuse and request the order is cancelled and I’m told a refund will be with me in 3-5 days. No refund received after 10 days so I contact them again only to be told the refund was failed to be processed and “Art” the supervisor emailed me to advise this. I have received nothing in my spam or regular emails on this. A further 7-10 days until I will receive my refund! We’ll see if this one actually comes through. Needless to say but Nike have lost a customer who used to buy and advise others to use their products. The customer service has been absolutely pathetic!,2020-05-14T14:12:07.000Z,Nike

Lack of accommodation for disabled athlete,Mary Margaret,1,"My sister, who has three teenage sons who all play competitive sports and are loyal Nike consumers, reached out to Nike to inquire about the ability to special order cleats for her son who has Cerebral Palsy and plays soccer. Due to his disability, he is in the need of two different sized shoes, a 12 and 9.5, which has led to my sister, who is a single mother, having to buy two pairs of shoes regularly to accommodate the shoe size difference and his rapid growth as a 16-year-old who is now over 6' tall. Nike has denied the willingness to accommodate this special order to provide the support my nephew's disability is needing for him to continue engaging in sports, which has been a huge confidence booster for him. As loyal Nike consumers, my family is all disappointed in Nike's lack of responsiveness to this - especially given the large platform and advertisement Nike gives to support athletes of all backgrounds. We will be searching for other brands that are willing to support the needs of ALL athletes - not just the famous disabled ones.",2020-05-14T02:16:55.000Z,Nike

Alongside that, the Nike box was placed into a slightly bigger box with no bubble wrap or other form of filler to keep it from being damaged or tossed around. Overall, shipping was 2 weeks which is very fast imo, updates of order was awful and the way it was packaged wasn’t great either.

Charged twice and takes ages,Georgia,1,Took ages to ship - seems everything is shipped from the EU which is not made clear on their site (I am in the UK). It’ll be about 3 weeks before I get my shoes which I need urgently (current ones have holes that are getting bigger daily). To make matters worse they’ve charged me twice - once at time of ordering and again at dispatch - thus sending me into unplanned overdraft which I will be penalised for. I’m told the original amount will be released to my account in 24 days (it was reserved not withdrawn); surely this reserved amount should have been drawn down upon rather than being charged again?! I’m sure many people wouldn’t have the cash flow to finance two lots of payments for the 24 days (and why are they holding for 24days it should only be 7),2020-05-04T06:53:29.000Z,Nike

Bought a pair of running shoes from…,Aidan Tanti,1,"Bought a pair of running shoes from London Nike store last December, Nike zoom Pegasus turbo 2 and it costed me 187 euros, now on both shoes I have got a tear just under the Nike badge. I was on holiday when I bought it and now I am in Malta. Have been using it for races and only done a total of 185km. After talking to them on chat, their only solution was to catch a flight and get back to London Nike store. Definitely disappointed with their service and product especially when it costs 187 Euros. Also asked if I can send it back by shipping and they said that it is not possible.",2020-04-28T12:38:04.000Z,Nike

Never will I shop Nike's again,Jamie,1,"Never will I shop Nike's again. Extremely disappointed. Not only was I informed it would take 5-7 business days to get the shoes prior to paying for them, but its been 14 days now and i still have yet to receive them... But also I was just recently informed that one of the pairs was cancelled due to insufficient inventory, which should be something Nike already needs to be aware of before a purchase is made. Very unprofessional due to any excuse, even if it is Covid-19, because atleast then you could give a heads up it may take longer then usual etc., I will definitely let my shoe loving friends know not to order from you guys, to make sure they dont get the experience I did.   Sincerely, Jamie Cauley",2020-04-27T20:18:36.000Z,Nike
TERRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE!,Cath 123,1,"TERRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE!I have contacted Nike multiple times because of an issue regarding a reserved amount on my account. First I contacted them pr. email where it seemed like they wouldn’t answer my question, they just answered me with a bunch of facts about my order that i already knew and that didn’t have anything to do with my question. Then i decided to call them, because maybe it was me who wasn’t able to put what i meant in writing. First i talked to a woman who was nice enough but she didn’t really answer my question still. So i decided to call them again, i then talked to THE RUDEST costumer service employee I have ever come across in my life. He YELLED at me, he wouldn’t believe what i was saying, and then when i tried to explain he HUNG UP!! This kind of terrible service is UNACCTEPABLE, especially when it is a huge company like NIKE!!",2020-04-27T10:17:25.000Z,Nike
4 weeks and still waiting for my trainers,Paul R,1,"4 weeks and still waiting for my exchange of trainers. Have queued and live chatted with three different agents- all assured me that they would authorise the exchange with proof of posting the original trainers which I supplied. Nothing happened. After speaking to a fourth agent on chat, was told that the exchange was now authorised. A week later the progress with my order still hasn’t updated. Waited an hour to actually speak to an agent- completely rude and indifferent agent ‘Caitlin’. Computer says- we’re still processing your order. What’s there to process Nike? It’s a pair of trainers! Take them off your Warehouse shelf and put them in the post! Caitlin completely unwilling to offer any assurance as to when my order would be dispatched. Useless.

Buggy website and Unhelpful Service,Ya Pal James,1,Buggy website and unhelpful customer service. I made sure my account was verified a week before the shoes I wanted released. My account was not receiving the verification text but by using my brother's mobile number I was able to verify my account after customer service apologized to me and simply said that I would not be able to buy shoes without a verified account. On the release of the shoe I connected my laptop to the ethernet cable to make sure my internet was running quickly. Every time I clicked buy on the shoe the website would either crash or say an error had occurred. Eventually the shoes sold out and I was unable to buy them.

After a while I got an email that I should provide them with my bank details for a refund. Strange that a company this size cannot simply send back the money to the account from which the payment was made. Anyway. I never received the refund. Tried to reach them and by phone or chat it takes ages. Finally reached them via a chat and was told I made a mistake with my bank details but they can't help me there and also can't tell me what was wrong or send me a link to give in bank details again. I was told I have to call them. After 20 minutes waiting on the line I started talking to a guy who finally seemed to be able to correct the bank details but then it seemed he didn't hear me anymore, even though I could hear him perfectly, so that conversation ended. Then I called again but after 15 minutes waiting on the line someone just hung up on me before I had a chance to utter a word. Then called again and, after another 15 or 20 minutes, talked to a woman who said she can't help me because she can't deal with any bank details herself. She will contact her manager and her manager will contact her and then she will give me a call and maybe will be able to send me an email with the link where I can leave my bank details!!!!!

Alls well..,Telont,5,Ordered Nike Free RN 5.0 Men's Running Shoe from a mail shot by Nike. Received email accepting order with delivery date by 30/3/20. A few days later Nike contacted to me and apologised that product delayed and could not guarantee by 30/3. Although disappointed it was not a big issue with the Self Isolation rules in place so I sat back and waited. On 28/3 I received another email telling me that the product was being shipped and that DPD would be delivering. Happy with that as they are my favourite delivery agent (other than PO). As I have the DPD App I checked today 29th with DPD and was informed parcel on the way to their depot and I would receive on 30th. Alls well that ends well and completely satisfied.

Flyknit shoes are the biggest pieces of crap.,Lynette Leanox,1,"I have to say that I went to buy a pair of shoes.   I saw a pair of Nike Flyknit shoes, priced close to $200 dollars.  I buy these shoes, not caring about the price because if I want something nice I realize I will have to pay.   I’ve always been told that you pay for what you get.  Mind you I bought these shoes about four months ago.  I take very good care of my things.  I am walking at work and all of a sudden two of the bubbles on my left shoe burst.  I then call the Nike corporate office and they gave me a claim number, in which we pay for shipping.  I then immediately ship these shoes to them all for them to say that they will not warranty these shoes because of a “rubbing or friction” which caused the things to pop.  I am very angry about this because we as consumers buy something, we should expect it to last.  Especially the cost of these shoes.  I have shoes that I have had for years that still look brand new and wear them almost daily and have had no problems. Nike Flyknit shoes are a joke and so is Nike.  I will never buy a pair of Nike shoes ever again.  I know it will not matter because so many people across the country buy from Nike and me not buying them will just be a drop in the bucket to them.  Everyone beware of these shoes as they are junk and definitely not worth the money I paid for them.  I will use them as dog chew toys when I receive them back.

Poor service from Nike customer service in Dublin,Jay,1,"I called customer service which directed me to Dublin to complain about a product I purchased from the Nike Factory on the 11th March 2020 in London. It was labelled incorrectly, I live 1.5 hours away as I total will cost me 3 hours of my time to get there and back. and all I wanted was a refund. I spoke to Ryan and Daniel who both were unhelpful. I asked Daniel to log a compliant and he said there’s no point as head office will not deal with it. I got to go back to the store!!! I asked him to ask the store to get in touch but he said no! It’s down to me to call them. The store has not been answering the phone so there has been no hope. I can’t believe a massive retailer like Nike has such poor customer service coming for the service line! And stated the head office wouldn’t deal with this either so no point logging the complaint. I just wanted to post the item back or perhaps go to another Nike store just not the factory as it’s out of my way.",2020-03-12T13:38:47.000Z,Nike

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY,David Myles,1,"Purchased Nike ID custom shoes year ago that arrived with shoddy workmanship but I allowed it and never contacted them. Purchased a new pair of Nike by you weeks ago and arrived in worse condition. Black stains that won’t remove from the upper, used and painted badly soles that are cracking and with chips already taken out. Contacted Nike only for them to say send them back. They did not care about me or the facts I’ve spent thousands over the years with their company. Also used a gift card for partial payment and asked for them to refund me in cash since I won’t be shopping with them again, they said no.

So I will keep it facts,Anne,1,"So I will keep it facts. Bought a present/surprise for my partner on 1st Feb 2020. It should be delivered on 3rd or 4th by DPD. I got a text message saying that it should delivered between 2-3 PM. I knew I'm not going in so chose it to be left at safe place. When came back home I checked safe place and it was not there, no card was left as well. Lucky I had CCTV's so I checked and fact was confirmed that driver was not even there. Then I checked the tracking number - and surprise! It says it was delivered and signed by me. So I called Nike - of course they didn't pick up the phone (as this was a gift I was not really happy to miss the birthday). I then called DPD and women answered. She checked and confirmed the fact that driver went to the wrong street and delivered to the wrong address (checked by GPS in DPD's car). She advised me to order new one so I could get this before birthday which was after a couple of days. She said I will be refunded and the item if found will be delivered back to Nike. I ordered new one at it was delivered after couple of days. Now the interesting part is that I still haven't received my item or refund. There was a DPD guy after a couple of days and asked me to sign for the item which I not received, he said the person for who driver delivered was at my address and left parcel ""somewhere near the door"", I checked cctv, yes there was a person (not sure if that's the one as, was away at the time), but cannot see if he left anything and more over I haven't found anything. It was one of the days when we had a windy days here in UK so not sure if he left or the wind took away but if it would be given to my hands I would sign for it (as it should be done in first instance) there wouldn't be any problems. So keeping in mind DPD did their mistake, but I bought from Nike - not from DPD and they are the one who should be responsible. I opened even paypal dispute, customer service a rude and saying every time different - they will check within 8 days, they will check within 9 days after I write every week to Nike. Now it's 4 weeks after and I haven't got nor my money nor my item. They even haven't apologised. I hate this company, won't buy anymore (keeping in mind their quality is going down). So that there wouldn't be stupid questions acting as they do care about me I will provide order reference number here, and do not contact me - I don't want to hear this brand name anymore!

I waited 50+ days for my order,Abby Cooper,1,"I ordered a pair of custom shoes on January 8th 2020, and they still haven't come!!!

I have been waiting for 7 weeks now and am getting frustrated at this point. I had even called the nike site to see what was happening with my order and the person on the end of the line wasn't very helpful. I thought I was going to get these court shoes on time for a tournament, as I am a high performance athlete and am in need of a new pair of shoes, and was extremely upset that they didn't come when they said they were supposed to. i am not one to complain easily but I could have not been more disappointed in a brand that I like so much.

I have to say, the online chat is always quick, easy and the agents are always so friendly and knowledgeable. Errors and mistakes happen, but it’s how a company and people deal with them.

DON'T ORDER FROM NIKE,Sarah Redmond Morris,1,"This is the second time I'm writing this review as it deleted my last one! :(At the end of January I ordered a pair of customized running shoes.

Feb 21 I received an email stating that they would be delivered in 1-4 days.  Feb 25 I called Nike customer service because I hadn't heard from Nike yet.  I was told that they would be delivered in April!  The customer service agent told me it would be best to take a refund.  He said it would be refunded in 1-2 days.  I asked him if I would receive an email with this information, but he hung up on me.  I did receive an email stating that my order was cancelled, but nothing was mentioned about my refund.  I guess if I don't get it in 2 days I'll have to call back.SO DISAPPOINTING  NIKE MUST do better!!",2020-02-25T16:15:54.000Z,Nike

POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!,Paris Lee Ann,1,I pre-ordered an item on Nike's website on 01/23. I received an email stating that this would be delivered by 02/03. A few days before the delivery date I received another email stating that my order would be arriving late on 02/05. For the inconvenience they provided me with a 20% off coupon. Awesome right? Not quite. On the new arrival date 02/05 I received another email stating that it will now be another 1-4 business days before it's arrival. On the 3rd business day we got ANOTHER email showing that I would no longer be receiving my order because it is not in stock. If you don't have enough of the item then it should not be listed as available! I also PRE-ORDERED this item WEEKS in advance because it would only be sold for a limited time. When I tried to get this resolved I was told that they would escalate my feedback and contact me in 2 to 3 business days to see what they can do for me. Over a week later I still hadn't heard from them. I called again and was told they would not compensate anything due to them sending a 20% off coupon already. This coupon was specifically for the order being LATE not for anything else. Not only was the order late but I also didn't receive it and they cancelled the order. Nike kept saying my order was coming instead of letting me know that it was out of stock. Now I will not get the chance to purchase this item since it is no longer sold! This was a horrible experience and I am super bummed that I won't get the chance to have this item.,2020-02-19T21:37:57.000Z,Nike

Absolutely the most disgusting customer…,Marcia Lee Ann Magennis,1,"Absolutely the most disgusting customer service or lack of it ever.  I would have expected more from such a big company.

Very poor response from nike from both emails and phone calls regarding this.  I am absolutely disgusted and will be telling everyone far and wide to NOT buy from this company.

pretty awful,R Roberts,1,"pretty awful - I ordered some shoes via telephone from their Irish call centre - presnet for my wife's birthday. After a week or so, no shoes arrived - I checked the Order Status, and it turned out they had cancelled the order. I called the call centre - was told that when they cancel orders, they don't inform the customer (apparently cancellation was because the bank details didn't quite match those with HSBC). Great - so no i have no present for my wife. Worse than that - there is a debit on my HSBC account for £239.95. They won't release it without something in writing from Nike (to confirm they won't be sending any shoes).  So another call is necessary to Nike in Ireland - the lady in the call centre says she is 'not authorised' to send me anything in writing confirming they will not fulfil the order.  Another long wait listening to elevator music, now ongoing....   really awful processes/customer service. Why not inform customers when orderes are cancelled? Why not put things in writing?    Crap.",2020-01-31T08:29:48.000Z,Nike

We were told they had tried to deliver them but couldn't find the address so instead of ringing the number on the order they returned them to the depot.  I was told they would get resent but nothing arrived so I had to make yet another call.  I was then old they had gone to Belgium!!  They were going to have them sent to us.  A week went by and still nothing not even a phone call or an apology up until now. My son was still wearing boots that were pinching his feet while we waited.  When I rung again I was told that they were refunding the money and not sending them to us.  Had I not rung then we would still be waiting.  I checked my account whilst on the phone to them and they hadn't refunded the money.  They said it would take a few days.  It didn't take that long when I paid for them!

Quality issues poor manufacturing what a joke.,Mr Daniel c,1,I have always bought Nike trainers in particular air max and collect them. Where Do i start late November 19 purchased a pair of Nike air max bowfins upon delivery they were faulty hole in the top upper mesh poor stitching so I returned purchased from footlocker. Early December (Christmas present)Nike air max 90 camowabb just released so I bought a pair from size.Co.Uk upon delivery poor stitching once again leather not sewn to the underneath fabric resulting in raw material exposed to the elements. So I once again retuned. One week later purchased Nike air max tailwind purchased from Nike.Com upon delivery whole in the leather were it joins the sole multiple stitching errors so I returned once again. This happened to me last year aswell at the same time of the year two different pairs of trainers both returned because of quality issues. Gets me thinking is nike selling factory seconds or even thirds at Christmas time because they no there is a less chance of people returning them as they are Christmas presents and family's wouldn't want there loved ones to go without at Christmas just my opinion but surely not a coincidence in my case. At £150-£200 a pair I expect a excellent quality trainer. P. S people always check the quality of your trainers when bought from Nike or any other retailer as I am buy no means paying this amount of money for a poor quality shoe.

This is a horrible company!!,Cassandra Dickens,1,"This is a horrible company!!! They sponsored and supported Micheal Vick even after he tortured poor helpless dogs !!! ""For all of you that say Vick should be forgiven - give this a read.Most people are aware that Michael Vick was a dogfighter. They may even have illusions of what they think dogfighting is at its worst or the suspected actions that take place. However, what Vick did was not simple dogfighting.I have struggled real hard with trying not to hold a past against someone because I believe in forgiving and that people can change. I have come to the conclusion that some things are simply unforgivable for me.Some of those things are what he chose to do.Picture your dog or your friends dog tossed to a couple of animals trained to fight for humans. Imagine that animal screaming as it is being ripped apart and having its throat ripped out. Imagine the person that tossed that helpless animal to the other animals just laughing as it occurs and later admitting he thought it was funny. That person who tossed the animals to the others is Michael Vick.Imagine taking a bucket used to hold water, filling it with water, and holding a dogs head in it until it drowns while it stands on land.Have you ever thought of the image of hanging a dog? He did that too. He also picked them up over his head before slamming them downward on concrete at his full force over and over.As a bodybuilder, I know the strength of professional athletes. Imagine the blunt force trauma that dog felt as it hit concrete over and over from not dying the first time.He also attached jumper cables to their ears and tossed them in a pool to electrocute them.This is not about dogfighting. That has become a separate issue. The acts in dogfighting are disgusting and reprehensible. What Vick did was to take it one step further and find a way to legitimately torture dogs like a horror movie.I know that he went to prison (he was sentenced to 23 months under RICO), but that was not for the animal torture.In Virgina, he was charged with two class-6 felonies, which each carried a maximum of 5 years in prison. He submitted a guilty plea to a single Virginia felony charge for dogfighting, receiving a 3-year prison sentence suspended on condition of good behavior, and a $2,500 fine. In return for the plea agreement, the other charge was dropped.Everyone else, but animal advocates, seem unaware of what he truly did and most are probably unaware of the time he actually served and for what basis.Upon exiting prison for RICO:He received a sponsorship from Nike and he went back to playing in the NFL.Now, he is an analyst on TV for football and he was just selected as a legends captain for the 2020 NFL Pro Bowl.All because the man could run fast with a football.And the general public does not seem to mind one bit about any of it.""",2019-12-29T00:37:03.000Z,Nike

This short is a fleece-like material inside, a little warm, and snug in the small size for wearing them playing tennis- the small size gives a little support, and the stretch in the material is enough so that having 2 tennis balls in my pocket doesn't cause any binding restriction of movement.They are also good for just lounging around in - the two front pockets are generous and I can easily carry my keys, and phone without fear of them falling out. The back pocket is equally sized and the snap ensures that when I have my wallet with me it will remain secure.I have washed them before wearing and the shrinkage is minimal- the blend of material doesn't dry very quickly but even hang drying the fabric stays soft.",2019-12-28T07:21:52.000Z,Nike

Over $1000 just on Nike.com and many other pairs through local shops. This is the worst experience I've ever had and I will NEVER be buying Nikes again. I am selling the pairs in my collection and will only be buying Adidas, Yeezys,New Balance and Under Armor from here forward. Nike doesn't care about it's customers whatsoever, and it shows. Was hoping they'd prove me wrong about that and they haven't even tried. So sad.",2019-12-26T20:55:33.000Z,Nike
Distrustful~ lost a loyal customer,Fernanda Barros,2,"A joke, a completely distrustful company. You’d think they’d be all for satisfying the consumer since they are a huge corporation and that they would have a sophisticated website. Well it’s just the opposite. I waited weeks for the Nike Air Force 1 and really needed them in time for a vacation coming up (01/03/20). Well finally they became available yesterday and I got the notification, therefore placing my order as soon as I saw the shoe “in stock”. I decided to do a pick up at my nearest Nike store so I could get them as quick as possible, the pick up would be for today (the next day). Woke up to an email saying that the shoe was out of stock and that I couldn’t go pick them up anymore because my order was canceled. You’d think they would let you know if they had the shoe available or not before you place it in your cart. I find this super unprofessional for such a large corporation.I called customer service and Dani was very nice, and helpful. She wanted to help in any way, shape or form possible. We decided to order .5 a size up, which I settled for. (Keep in mind that their shipping takes 2-4 days)Well I placed the order with Dani in order for us to see the estimated shipping arrival date, and the shipping arrival date was, you guessed it longer than 4 days. It was 7 days, this would not be an appropriate date, due to my vacation which was much earlier than that. I ended up canceling my order this morning and I am very unhappy with the Nike company. I have been a loyal customer for various years and am dissatisfied with the service they provide, especially with the handling of their inventory control.",2019-12-26T14:54:36.000Z,Nike
Nike...c'mon!,greg,1,"JEEEEZE... so, I found out, after live chatting with Charles (great guy, super informative, helpful and transparent) that you can not use a gift card on the Nike.com website, UNLESS it is from Nike ONLY. Like ... what!??!? So the policy is, you can not use a 3rd party gift card, you have to purchase a gift card on a 3rd party site, wait for delivery (email or physical) and then use it. NOWHERE AT CHECK OUT, does Nike mention this. NOWHERE! This is a joke (the lack of information and the policy itself). I have placed many, many orders on the website, first time using a gift card. This has turned me off completely of their website (I have had a bad experience with their CX before this [sent me out a ""new"" pair of sneakers with stains on them and then wouldn't let me return them]) . While I love Nike products and will continue to purchase and wear, the policies, procedures and overall customer experience on their website needs a complete redoing. You have made it so unpleasant to shop on your site. I am sure I am not the only one. Merry F***ing Christmas Nike",2019-12-24T17:36:07.000Z,Nike

Delayed delivery,Grace,1,"On 1st December 2019, I bought my boyfriend quite expensive golf shoes online. I quickly realised I had ordered the wrong size. I contacted Nike who said they can't change sizes that were ordered online. They told me to contact them when I get my dispatched email and that they would be able to reroute the parcel to them, then refund me and I can place another order. When I got the dispatched email, I phoned them and they told me they can't reroute the package and I just have to return it when the package arrives. My initial delivery date was 9th December. 2 days ago I got an email from Nike to say my package had been delayed for up to 2 weeks ""due to unforeseen circumstances"" and here is 20% off your next order. I don't think there will be another order, ever! According to the ""track my package,"" UPS say it has been in Dublin for 2 days at this stage. I got an email from Nike today to say it will be with me by 23rd December. The package is only going to Carlow! 11 days to get from Dublin to Carlow??!! UPS call themselves a courier service? That is ridiculous. As I won't be around from 22nd, for my boyfriend to get his Christmas pressie, I am going to have to bring him out and buy another pair as the size of the ones in transit are wrong. I hadn't budgeted for this. A very costly mistake on my part. Once I get my refund (God only knows when that will happen!) I will never shop for Nike online again. I will only buy from a retailer.

Would give -5 if I could,Fry,1,I have made over 5 calls to Nike over the past 50 days totaling more than 2 hours of wasted time trying to get a refund for the wrong shoes Nike sent me.  The website says refunds take 1-2 days!!!  Avoid this company like the plague.We were sent 'too small shoes' as gift.  Nike.com initially refused to exchange them but eventually agreed to the exchangeOne month passes from initial order - Nike.com sends the same 'too small' shoes again ignoring my request to size up to from W 10 to W 11.5.  Nike.com insists they cannot exchange shoes two times and claim they cannot fix their own mistake.  They say they'll issue a gift card so I can repurchase the shoes.  They also promise to send coupons for 15% off next purchase and free shipping due to the inconveniences that were never received.  Two months pass and still no gift card or coupons.  I call again and this time request a refund.  They want to refund me a lower sale price which I insist is immoral and corrupt.  They tell me the refund will be issued 1-2 weeks.  Three months pass and still no refund.  Call again and get the same run around.  They have now sent notice that I should be receiving a gift card even though I have insisted multiple times on a refund.,2019-12-11T16:18:07.000Z,Nike

However the last 2 pairs i bought, 1 of which were custom design and not cheap, have literaly fell apart in a matter of a few miles but it was a few months later so no chance of refunds. These were only ever used for light walking and driving and were not used every day as i still had older trainers that i used for work etc. It seems like they are designed to fail after a short period so you buy more but maybe it will have the opposite effect as I know a few people who have stopped buying Nike trainers because of the poor quality. At around £150 a pair for a few miles of normal walking it just doesnt add up.

They aren't interested in taking any responsibility whatsoever. They tried saying that the name had to be typed the exact way it appears on the card.

All the other sites I could have ordered the same shoes from are now out of stock so I lost out due to very poor inventory management from Nike.com.

Horrible service,Wasay,1,"I bought two pairs of sneakers from their website during the weekend and paid extra for 2 day shipping. However, on the day they were supposed to arrive, I got an email from them saying that they never even shipped them. I called them and they basically send they're sorry and that I have to expect them to arrive 8 days from the day they were supposed to arrive (not even 8 days from when I ORDERED them).....extremely disrespectful. I have never had a company handle their own mistakes like this before. I purchased a pair of Yeezys from Adidas on the same day and they arrived first thing in the morning (also purchased with 2-day shipping). Nike's customer service is essentially useless as well, all they do is parrot the same script to you and until you go away. They seem to legitimately not care about their customers. Just to give a comparison to a similar situation. I had ordered whey protein with 2-day shipping from Amazon a few months ago. They ended up delivering it to the incorrect mail room in my apt complex. I called them the day of to inform them of what happened. They ended up actually giving me ANOTHER one for FREE with NEXT DAY shipping and I received it early the next morning. That SHOWS me that they genuinely care for their customers if their willing to ship and entire 5 Lbs package with next day shipping for free. Im not expecting a free product from Nike, I just want my package to arrive the day I ordered. And if it's not shipped the day it was supposed to, then tell me THEN, not the day it was supposed to arrive. They promised they'd give me shipping details the day I had called them, still no information. What kind of ridiculous service is this? Why would I ever want to buy or recommend anyone to buy their products ever? Now after reviewing the other reviews on here, even the QUALITY of the shoes  are questionable. So, I guess I have to wait and see if I need to return the shoes because the soles start coming off. Even then they probably won't refund it.",2019-12-05T22:32:01.000Z,Nike

I have never had a customer service…,Ginger Callison,1,"I have never had a customer service experience as bad as I had with Nike. While I am almost certain I entered our business suite number in the address portion of my order, Fed Ex explained that it didn't show up on their order information. Perhaps I left it off...but when I tried to correct the information I was unable to provide this information witho Fed Ex. Fed Ex explained that they were unable to fix the address on the package because of ""restrictions"" placed by Nike. Fed Ex then explained that I had to call Nike directly to fix my address. So, after at least 20 minutes on the phone with Fed Ex, I called Nike. When I did (after also being on hold), I was told this had to be ""escalated"" by the customer service rep, even when I provided the tracking number, my name, phone number, etc. to them.I will never, ever order from Nike again. I wasted at least an hour on the phone and finally wound up canceling my order.I've never taken the time to write an online review before--that's how annoying this experience was.

I quickly emailed customer service and had a reply the following day from Denzell who explained that the code expired at 12 midnight on Central European Time and not Greenwich Mean Time.  I batted a few emails back and fore asking them to honour the discount as clearly this was a computer glitch as the system obviously knows we are in the UK as the pricing is in GBP and not Euros, therefore the deal should have been available until the end of Friday.  They did not budge and loyal customers don't seem to count for anything, they seem to prefer to have disgruntled customers than happy customers!

Nike does not stand behind the quality…,Richard A. Forbes,1,"Nike does not stand behind the quality of their products and after being a customer for 25 years, I will never ever buy another Nike product again because of it. I had a pair of nike running shoes tear apart after 4 months of use. I contacted the Nike store where i purchased them and all they could say was they had a 90 day return policy and they could do nothing about the bad quality shoes that tore apart. I contacted enough Nike people until I was speaking with the Senior Customer Management rep and after 3 phone calls their best solution was to say they stand behind their 90 day policy instead of standing behind delivering a high quality product. In the best case scenario I hoped Nike would offer to exchange the shoes for a pair that were not torn apart, but they didn't think that was a reasonable request. Nike did not even think to offer even a 50%, 25%, 10%, 1% discount on a new pair of shoes. Their best suggestion was to go buy a new pair of shoes and hope the next pair don't rip apart. I am absolutely appalled at this level of service from such a reputable company.

Complete dismay 😂,Thomas Rothwell ,1,"Complete dismay 😂. Placed an order through the app on 01/11/19, apparently 3-5 business days for delivery. Have since had this delivered on 4 different occasions in dribs & drabs, the last was on 23/11/19. Contacted this company on various instances inbetween these dates to try & get an understanding on when/what is being delivered etc, they couldn't be specific. Upon receiving my last delivery on the 23rd I contacted them once again on the 26th to inform them that I was still 1 item missing from my total order, they told me this has been cancelled from the order due to it not being in stock; to re-iterate I placed this order 22 days before I was told an item was not in stock, is this acceptable? When I asked why it wasn't in stock but it was when I initially placed the order, I was told that my order was delayed for 20 days due to a glitch on their system, & when they went to pick it at the warehouse on the 22nd it was no longer in stock (they couldn't tell me what the glitch was). Apparently I will be refunded in 5-9 business days - however, I won't be holding my breath. The operator towards the end of the call politely offered to check if the item was now in stock for me (3 days after cancelling my order I had waited 22 days for).

Then they advise me to call back in two days which I did. Placed order again promised free next day delivery. That was 4 days ago. Still no sign of trainers.

Can't refund my order from Nike online order,Artem,1,"Ordered Nike online while being in the UAE. Was concerned about the return but Nike assured me that I have plenty of time to make a free return and it would be very easy in case my order doesn't fit.Order arrived, it didn't fit, I issued a return on the website. The delivery guy didn't come on the expected date and 3 days already have passed. Nike.com customer support told me that they can't do anything about it since the purchase was made outside of the US. They gave me 2 phone numbers, a toll-free one that doesn't exist and a local UAE one that belongs to a partner SunAndSandSports. I reached those guys, and guess what? I can't get a refund for my order! Only exchange is possible and ""they are doing that only because I'm a Nike client""...So here I am, trying to exchange the order that didn't fit to something else instead of getting my money back.

Nike's poor quality of website and support make it impossible to order products,Remon,1,"Had probably one of the worst e-commerce experiences this week with Nike.Started with a problem of a very 'bugged' website that had trouble with changing address details and deleting old address information stored. Kept popping back in the previous settings. Even with cookies/cache cleared, things would still not be processed correctly.Second problem: payment. Wouldn't allow me to pay and after three attempts, using different methods - all without success (due to the glitchy address settings). Jumped on a call with Nike and literally got the feedback: there's nothing we can do, you'll have to wait 24 hours and try again. So I figured to do it via another device/browser and use another payment method. This time it succeeded! YAY! However next morning when I checked on my Nike app, the order had been mysteriously cancelled without notification or any form of explanation as to why. I now had to go and make sure those payments got cancelled from my end in order for not wasting any money on a cancelled order by Nike.I went on the online chat support to get more information and they replied:-Thanks for your patience with us. I am very sorry to inform you that your order has been cancelled because we were unable to verify your billing information or it can also mean that payment details or other crucial information is missing or incompatible. Nike takes your security seriously. Due to the fact that we could not verify your PayPal details, we were unable to send out confirmation at risk of jeopardising your digital security.   For automatic system cancellations, no email is sent. This is a security measure for our consumers, due to the possibility of it being an unauthorised transaction.-'So a security measure?' without informing your customers is the right thing to do? Why not contact the customer and ask them for a confirmation what so ever?Anyway, so I ask for them to re-enable the order (it was an order of 11 items and I didn't feel like having to search them and add them again to make another order without knowing if this time it would work). Nike's reponse: -I am very sorry as we can't reinstate the cancelled order. As much as I would love to assist you with a new order, for security purposes, we don't want to capture any payment information within our chat transcript. We don't place order via chat or e-mail.-So I set aside my pride and start trying to add items to my basket again, then the next thing happens when I try to open the cart section (nike com/gb/en/cart): {""error_id"":""d1639aef-3936-426b-a1f5-e487ffe47575"",""errors"":[{""code"":30,""message"":""Forbidden access""}]}.So I clear all cookies/cache, relog into my account, everything appears to be as usual, but now every time I go into the cart section, it gives me the same error message. Unable to make any purchases what so ever.I'm starting to get annoyed by the poor level of quality and service provided so I ask through the same chat window with the support if they can file a complaint. Nike's reponse:-What I can do here is capture your feedback. As of the moment, we don't have a complaint process online, Remon.-So you have:- A flawed billing system / account management- Poor support- No space for complaints directly with your support chat- You can't help me sort out the order and reactivate itWhat is the point of even buying from Nike then? Is the product that good, that you can have one of the worst user experiences and basically leave your customers with nothing, not a single form of help?EDIT: So whilst writing this review I have been online with chat support and trying to at least get some form resolve. But now the support typist I'm with has been 'typing....' for the last 35 minutes or so. The chat transcript is laughable (you'll see how little they care or do for their customers).Another thing that happened now is: The app on my phone and my user account on Nike are inaccessible. The horror story continues.EDIT2: It's been almost a week now and my app is functional again. The order that failed has been somehow erased entirely from this system. I was ensured by Nike employee over the phone that a Manager would be in touch with me, which hasn't happened to this day. Nike... what on earth are you doing?EDIT in June 2020: Half a year later and Nike still hasn't taken the effort to even read or reply to this post. It's a shame Nike.EDIT in February 2021: Nike still hasn't replied or given any care about this. Bye Nike!",2019-11-06T10:23:54.000Z,Nike

Nike Customer Service is disgusting,andrew welling,1,"I purchased a nike Apple watch 5 which they despatched via ups and 10 days later have still not received it. It's obvious that someone at ups has stolen it but they insist on an 8 day investigation by ups and in the mean time I have no watch and am over 400 quid out of pocket, their customer service is disgusting as they are just not interested (the customer is not their main concern) and after this is sorted i will not be buying from nike again. What they should do is send out a replacement watch as it's not my fault their delivery company is so poor.I would rather go to someone who cares about their customers.",2019-10-19T21:51:35.000Z,Nike

I will give Nike a negative 5 for…,Wayne ,1,I will give Nike a negative 5 for customer service. I bought a pair of Nike shoes a month ago for my son and the shoes have a hole worn in the toe. One month old shoes should not be worn out already. I called Nike customer service yesterday and the said that I would have to send back the shoes to them and the would look at whether or not it was a manufactured defect or just worn out.  So they said there is a 2 year warranty for them but o will have to send them the shoes back at my cost for shipping and in 5-7 weeks they would either send me new shoes or send me the old ones back. I walked into a Nike store and the manager said that he has seen this a lot with this type of shoe and if I had bought the shoes with them he would take them back but I didn’t buy them from Nike. We got the shoes from famous footwear and there policy is they would take them back if they were not worn. So I’m stuck in this position now I ha e to buy my son another pair of shoes a month after I bought the other ones and pay to ship them back to Nike and wait to see if they will do the return. I think that their policy sucks and being I have the receipt that says when I bought them should stand for something.,2019-10-16T19:20:33.000Z,Nike

Don't buy gift cards from Nike.Com!,Deger O.,1,"I received a gift card as a birthday gift. I didn't use it for couple of months since the website says it doesn't expire. When I tried to use it in a nike store (after picking items I wanted to buy), the cashier told me that I could only use it online. When I went to the online store, the card gave an error. I called customer services and after waiting for many minutes to speak to someone, and for that someone to speak to someone else... she told me that the card had expired, but that ""I shouldn't worry"" because they would issue me a new one.... which would take 3 - 5 days and she would call me to give me the new card number... The story is clear and honest.. The issue may seem to have been solved. BUT imagine buying a 'gift' for someone and him/her having to go through such a hassle to be able to use that gift?! This is not customer-centred service, it is organization-centred service! This was even clearer when the lady said she could only call me (and not email me) because she is a phone-agent. Apparently phone agents and email agents are different people sitting in different departments and the organisational system does not allow them to communicate with each other. Unbelievable!

Even i paid the importing fee afterwards when i got them back from their claim department. Means i paid 350 dollars for this worst shoes ever.

My son bought me my first pair of nikes…,Evedavid48,1,"My son bought me my first pair of nikes for mother’s day in May , they were on sale for 130$ from 180$ after 2 months the sole wore down and the rubber separated , a hole inside the shoe formed where my big toe would go , I called Nike  and explained my situation I still had receipt , they said I can ship them back on my dime and if they feel that this damage is NOT normal wear and tear or there is a defect they will ship me a new pair and if it is normal wear and tear they will ship them back to me but they are not responsible if the shoes get lost on the way back . So I went to the store where I bought them and they did an even exchange 😁 that was in July when I got the second pair now we are in September and the same thing is happening to this pair rubber on sole is separating, worn down rubber on the sole , hole where big toe is inside shoe . These shoes are garbage I will never buy them again and the warrantee on the shoes is bull   I buy 35$ sneakers that last me 6 months to a year and I can’t even get two full months out of these",2019-09-06T00:11:30.000Z,Nike

We were supposed to receive last week, or earlier, but then got an email that they would be another two weeks. When contacting customer service they couldn’t do anything but give 15% off of a future order....I really like Nike should do better. Now I know to use Amazon more!!

Won't buy from Nike again,John Wigsten,1,"I placed an order online on July 29, 2019 based on the information provided on the myniketeam.com that stated the uniforms would ship in 4 - 5 business days from order placement.    On August 6, 2019 I followed up as I had not heard a thing from them.  They replied on August 7, 2019 with ""Please be advised: Blank stock product (including uniform bottoms) - Estimated ship time is 7 business days.  Arrival time is based on ship method chosen at checkout (+ 5-7 days for ground, +2 days for expedited). You should receive an email with tracking shortly! Thanks, Nike TEAM""On August 9 I followed up again as I still had not received any tracking information.  The replied with ""Hi John, Your order is still processing. Please be advised this is a very busy time for Nike Team as we work to fulfil back to school orders for the 85,000 schools we serve. We are working diligently to process and ship your order as quickly as possible. Your understanding and patience are greatly appreciated. Tracking will be sent as soon as it ships via email.""On August 17, 2019 they sent this to me""Hi John, I’ve spoken with my team and the shipment to Guam needed some routing assistance. The carrier was an issue, but traffic moved this over to UPS WW Exp on Wednesday so you should receive a tracking number soon.""On August 24, 2019 I asked for tracking information as I still had not received this information.  They replied with this ""Hi John, Here is the tracking number we have for you via FedEx: 415737046220""So not it went from being shipped UPS WWE back to FEDEX.  On August 28, 2019 I followed up again on shipment as the FEDEX tracking site only showed they had created a shipping label.  I was told when following up to call FEDEX.  I did and FEDEX told me the order had not been tendered (called for pick up) by NIKE to FEDEX.August 29, 2019 ""they told me they are looking into this.""So now my order has been sitting in Dayton, Tennessee 30 days since ordering on July 29, 2019.  I asked on 3 separate occasions for an email address, phone number and name of someone I could call to discuss with someone but never received a thing from them until September 5, 2019 when they told me ""We cannot give out the names and emails of the personnel on our team in charge of shipping over in our factory.  Nike Team is a brand new site and unfortunately there have been a few glitches in our system which is one of the reasons there were issues getting you your order in a timely fashion. The confusion can be attributed to the training of new employees and we apologize for the frustration this has caused you. We do hope you accept our sincerest of apologies.A complete and utter failure on their part.  Then I call NIKE.com # 1 800 344 6453 to be told I am dealing with a partner of Nike and there is nothing they can do.  I was not asking nor did I ever ask for a discount for their failure.  A little empathy, training and customer service would have sufficed.  So now I will only buy Adidas, Asics or UA when buying my running gear, team clothing etc.  Thanks for taking ownership of your vendors Nike!",2019-09-05T06:47:39.000Z,Nike
I will never order from Nike.com again,Natasha A Smith,1,"I will never order from Nike.com again! I ordered shoes for my daughter and backpacks for my boys. I received the shoes no problem. I returned the shoes because they were too small for her. I was still waiting on the backpacks when I received a notice that the bags were being sent back due to bad postal code. Called them they informed me they already received the shoes and weren't sure why I didn't receive the bags or how the postal code changed. I explained why I was so overwhelmed and stressed out from this situation because school was going to start in a week and now I have to spend my weekend driving around town to find them backpacks. They offered to comp(refund) the order and send it back out to me. I was so great full & ecstatic I wouldn't be spending my entire weekend looking for other bags. They took my address 4 times to make sure it was correct! Well I never received it! The order was sent back AGAIN for the same reason! I called back and they escalated to a supervisor. I've called several times to ask when the sup should be contacting me and to no avail. Now it's been 30 days so I call again only to get in touch with a supervisor who offered me a discount on my next purchase!!! There was nothing the sup could do about the comp order I never received. So for all of the time, overwhelming stress, hardship, frustration, hurt, and anger they have caused my children and I we were offered a 20% discount on our NEXT order!!! Yeah that's never going to happen! Like we'd place our trust in them to get it right the next time and on top of that they couldn't make things right this time!

It got canceled again. I called them again and I ordered the shoe trough the phone. My order got canceled again called them again and they told me that it must be my bank's fault.

No stars,Cherry Ryder,1,"No stars.  I bought a pair of Nike trainers costing £65 from Sports Direct which lasted 3 months just walking, no running.  The shop wouldn’t accept them back saying it’s wear and tear so I got in touch with Nike directly .  The examined the shoes and agreed they were faulty and gave me a code to buy another pair.  I couldn’t see anything suitable so contacted them. They said I had to have a replacement from their website ITS THEIR POLICY.  After numerous phone calls and e.mails and the supervisor promising to phone me back, which he didn’t, nothing was done.  They just expected me to pay the extra money.  Why not just send me a gift voucher to buy another pair?  I know why because their prices are way higher than any other retail outlet.  Nike you should be ashamed!",2019-09-02T18:06:09.000Z,Nike

I advise people not to deal with NIKE at all bc they do not care about their customers at all and could careless of your needs or feelings, they just pretty much say owell, we can issue you a refund but cant explain nothing else!!!!!!!!!! I give no stars at all bc they deserve nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They also said that my order has been elevated but not sure what that means to them except to sit back and do nothing bc nothing has been done or said except  sorry. this is unacceptable and is not right.

I was expecting to see five star reviews across the board, but it turns out Nike really is an incompetent and neglectful company. For the money we spend buying their products, they should be a little more competent. Their customer service “experts” are amateurs at best. I ordered a pair of customized Prestos and asked for sizing advice for men. The “expert” reassured me to go with a smaller whole size as they don’t make them in half sizes. Two weeks later I received the shoes and they don’t fit. Turns out they are for women and they don’t make the sneakers for men in those colors right now. I think that should have been assessed and addressed in the beginning. It doesn’t take and “expert” to figure that out.",2019-08-08T23:51:06.000Z,Nike

I then explained that he was looking into it and she continued ""it says at check out you cant"". Extremely rude, lack of care for customers and lack of finding solutions for customers online.

Laziness,Eman Resu,1,"Laziness, lies and then some.TLDR: Nike does not care about their customers, except for getting their money. Nike won’t give you a shoe suggestion based on a given criterion / customer needs if you ask a question that requires just a little bit of research. They also lie right to you and won’t even think twice about it.Full review:I’ll keep this as “short” as possible, but it is a long one. For reference, the one star review pertains to Nike as a company and one manager who lied to me / mislead me. This does not apply to the representatives that spoke to me. They were fine.Background:I have been wearing the Nike Air Pegasus for 13+ years. I am a forward foot runner as well, feel free to look that up if you want, there are videos on youtube that show the difference in slow motion of the 2 kinds of runners. For those that don’t want to look that up just know there are heel toe runners and forward foot runners. Heel toe runners can run comfortably in nearly anything, even combat boots. Forward foot runners sadly cannot. We require flexible shoes that bend near the center.I noticed that the Nike Air Pegasus 32 and above were not very good shoes for a forward foot runner at all. They did not bend much, and when they did bend it took way too much force to do so. That means it puts a lot of force on the bridge of my foot. That means potential injury. In January of 2019 I then called up Nike.com to ask them one basic question, with the expectation that they would get back to me, boy was I wrong. I asked Nike to compare the design of the Nike Air Pegasus 27, 28, 29 and 30, relative to the sole, the design of the sole, where the bend in the sole was, the PSI it takes to bend the front of the shoe back and all other aspects of it. Ie, I want something very close to that shoe in design. I wanted to know what shoe(s) they make are closest to those shoes in terms of specs, numbers. Not a hard question in my eyes, especially given that they have the data. (With the information i know now, i guess i was speaking ancient greek to them, asking for the meaning of life...) They said repeatedly that they would get back to me and they never did. I called and called. Each time I would call they would not have my original question(s) I asked. Each time I called I had to repeat the question, and then they would say that they would call me back. Nobody ever did. This went on for SIX months. SIX. The third to final time I called I was told by somebody, I think a manager, that the information I am after is proprietary and they cannot give it out. At this point I asked just for a shoe recommendation then after they research it. That did not go well and I ended up hanging up in frustration. The best part happened after that third to last call. I called a third party company that gave me the information I had been asking Nike about for six months. They just nonchalantly gave it to me over the phone on the FIRST telephone call. Nike claims something is proprietary, yet another company has the data I am after and gladly gives it to me. Nike does not keep their secrets very well hidden. If the data I was after was/is proprietary, they need to hire better security. Their testing lab seems to have a massive leak or a mole.That third party company suggested a shoe that worked for my needs and I placed an order. After testing the shoe out I then bought two more pairs from Nike, as that site ran out of the shoe. I will NEVER go back to the company. With their poor customer service, lies, deceit, and outright refusal to suggest a shoe that would work for my needs (based on data, not just guess work) they burned any bridges built over a 13+ year period with me. They do not care about their customers at all, at least based on how they acted towards me. They won’t do basic research to help find a shoe that will work for a customer with specific needs, even though they are the ones that has the data on their shoes. Lazy, VERY lazy. Terrible customer service and outright lies. DO NOT BUY FROM NIKE.",2019-07-19T14:50:33.000Z,Nike

When visiting London we bought our daughter some high performance running tights for £80.00. She’s had them for about 4 weeks and a hole has appeared which I think was tiny when we bought them and unnoticeable. The hole has grown and when we called customer services to ask if these could be replaced, as our daughter had cut the itchy ticket out they said there was nothing they could do! Wow how helpful! I think this is a terrible way to treat customers who regularly buy Nike products and I would recommend you always ensure the expensive item you purchase is in perfect condition before you leave the shop. Otherwise you could be as disappointed as us!",2019-07-11T17:58:12.000Z,Nike
Don't Buy Directly from Nike,Chris,1,"Bought two pairs of shoes from Nike.com. Needed to return one pair because they didn't fit. Here's the problem: Nike didn't provide free return shipping. At first glance this might not seem like a big deal, but I think it's unacceptable. Nike.com charges full retail price, so they're taking not only their manufacturer's profit but also the profit that would normally go to a retailer. Other retailers like Zappos.com manage to provide free return shipping while not taking this double profit. Even when retailers charge for return shipping they will often at least provide the customer with a prepaid shipping label allowing easy drop off. I was forced to take my package to a US post office or else pay double the shipping cost at a UPS store. Bottom line - returning a pair of shoes to Nike.com was expensive and time-consuming. I would never buy directly from them again.",2019-07-11T05:04:43.000Z,Nike

Delivered wrong product and no service,Raju,1,"Recently I have ordered a 42 mm Apple watch series 3 from Nike online because there was a sale, and so the watch was coming at a lower price. Unfortunately they have delivered a 38 mm watch.I have reported the issue to customer services, but they were not ready to send me the 42 mm watch. Instead they have asked me to return the 38mm watch and place a new order for the 42 mm watch. Surprisingly they don't have a courier pickup service and as a result they have asked me to go to the post office return the watch. Once I email the post office receipt to Nike, they say that they will refund my money.After quite an unpleasant conversation with their customer service, I tried to place the order, but the 42 mm watch was sold out. Now they are suggesting to wait until the product is available BUT there is NO GUARANTEE that I will get this watch at the price that I originally ordered it at. If I want to purchase the same watch from them, I have to pay an extra £164. THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING! Now because of Nike's mistake, now I have to pay extra money.This is totally unfair and they don't care for customers. In addition to this they have the most terrible and cruel customer service. Today I have phoned them up, and the person on the other side of the phone, just said: ""I'm very sorry"", and ""I can't help you anymore"".If that's not enough of a tragedy for you, THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT!

This is so disappointing.  The flag represents our country and how much we have grown and changed since becoming a nation.  I fought for it and still respect it.  The flag  is more than one person or company.  Just ask people at Fort McHenry in September 1814 who hoisted the US Flag high during bombardment and they kept the flag flying. The flag over Ft McHenry had 15 stars and strips to represent our young nation, Through wars and conflict people died to defend the US flag and the great country it represents.

However, to stand against the tyrant King George III, slavery would have to be tabled for a later date simply because the most pressing problem was winning the war after declaring our Independence. The flag that everyone is talking about is also referenced to the first American Political Cartoon by someone called Benjamin Franklin, Join or Die and has a snake with the different colonies aka Sons of Liberty.

Betsy Ross was a Quaker, and a staunch supporter of the abolitionists. But yet again, history is distorted, and nobody bothers to fact check what these clowns decide to spew and who decide they cannot function if there is an image that offends them.

Signs of the times:,Steve Dale,1,"Signs of the times:The focus here is that Colin is making money on a treasonous act.  He doesn't care about Betsy Ross.  He doesn't care about slavery.  He cares about making money!  There is not one other person in the world that thinks that a Betsy Ross flag relates to slavery of the times.  Nike doesn't get it!  It's all about money to them.  Colin's deal had died and there was no more money!  Colin opens his mouth and creates money for himself, and Nike.  The only slavery here is that Colin's actions have made a slave out of Nike.  If he doesn't create an issue then he falls out of the news.  Well sir, you will not fall out of the news.  You are now embedded in history.  Martin Luther King was a great man.  A man who served his position with respect from all.  He wasn't shooting his mouth off.  He was a true defender of the people and his belief.  He had respect.  People followed him.  No one is following you.  Your platform only creates descension and hatred.  Nike is just a slave to a really bad idea and cause.  Question for Nike:  Why did you pick this loser?  Hatred.....Hatred.....  What did America ever do to you?  God knows....You aren't that big of a company to place yourself in this position.  Tell Colin to take a hike and join the winning team.

I Even Gave Nike a Pass the Last Time.....RELUCTANTLY,glenn sandler,1,"I have been a NIke customer since the 70's when they first came to market. The days that Adidas had the majority of the market, i made the jump. The reason why Nike was my choice was  i believed they were the American Alternative. even through the last 40 years, i believed they (Nike), were the all american brand. Everything I do in life and have the opportunity to do in my life is because of America. Plain and Simple. Like any family, we have good and bad times and America is no different. But it the most beautiful place on the planet and has been for last 243 years. We as American's need to love and respect the flag, EVERY FLAG through history, especially the Betsy Ross Flag. Betsy Ross was a part of history and loved America, loved people...ALL PEOPLE, no exceptions...NONE.I cannot even imagine anyone, especially NIKE to take a stance on saying the American Flag is not beautiful, it is the most beautiful symbol of opportunity and peace on the planet. When Betsy Ross decided to sew cloth together to symbolize how great we are, the world was in a place with no freedom, only tyranny. The flag has been a symbol of America, which don't get me wrong, but gave Nike their opportunity for success as well. Now they want to spit on the flag  and spit on every American. What Nike has done is the most selfish, unAmerican act of throwing out what has made them great. Isn't it funny, someone at Nike thought it was a great idea to put the flag on the shoes in the first place, which is how we see America in the eyes of Americans' only to pull it off in an act of disgrace, i really can't believe it, i am astonished. I am just one person and obviously i do not mean anything to Nike, But i promise I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING NIKE AGAIN AS LONG I LIVE. I am throwing out my thousands of dollars of Nike equipment in the trash and not giving it to charity, i wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing that someone is walking around in the most UnAmerican Brand in the world.

It's a reminder of how this great country was founded and the brave men, both black and white, that gave their lives so this country might exist. Your leadership team doesn't know their history or care.  Sure, slavery was terrible and a regrettable part of our history but when one man simply states that he's offended by our flag and history and your company turns it back on this country it's a sad day.

Foot Locker and Nike worst experience…,Irini,1,Foot Locker and Nike worst experience ever. Long story short my daughter bought Nike TN's on sale. After 3 months of wearing the soles were so worn down they looked like they were owned for years. Contacted Nike who had Foot Locker contact me(which took long till Matthew from there contacted me) he told us we could exchange for other color or shoe etc. We went to Foot locker only to have to deal with an annoying manager (Julianne) who tries to give me explainations as to why they are wore out and that she should not be wearing them everyday. Seriously?! Also to get a different color same shoe we had to pay the difference.  I forgot to mention my daughter in 20 and not an athlete just wears them to walk. So Julianne would not accept the email and tells me to come back another day so she could get in touch with Matthew. It takes me 1/2 hr by car and 1hr by bus I was not leaving without a shoe. So after 3 hrs of wasting my time she finally get in touch with Matthew who now tells me because they do not have the same color she needs to pay the difference to get a different color.  Well that is not what the email said. Did get  our money back but had been hassled few weeks before that from again Julianne who back then refused us an exchange or a refund. Also my son bought TN'S  full price which also fell apart. Those also were returned. So Nike and Foot Locker are absolutely horrible in customer service and quality of workmanship. What do I get in return for the stress and my wasted time? Nothing. Stay away from Foot Locker especially in Cairns Central Australia.,2019-06-25T22:24:31.000Z,Nike
Worst Customer Experience I have ever had!!!,Jon B,1,"I have been an avid customer of Nike for going on 25 years. I buy new shoes every month just about. I ordered a rare color scheme shoe for my girlfriend's special birthday from Nike that they and only Finishline had in stock.The order said that it would get to me within 5-7 days. 6 days in and USPS notifies me that her package was there so I raced home to get it before she found yet. But... When I got home, there was no package. I called Nike immediately to have a customer service rep apologize and tell me that USPS actually lost the package aka probably stolen. He said that he would ship out the same order immediately and have it overnight shipped to make it in time for my girlfriends' birthday as she has wanted these shoes for some time.I call back after another 5 full days of hearing and seeing nothing. A new customer service rep said that nothing in my notes says that there was another package on its way. I was extremely upset and asked for a manager. No manager was around... shocking... and she said that she would offer me a refund. Even a refund wouldn't help with the issue Nike has now caused me but I accepted it.What do you know... Another 4 days go by and no refund. I call back today for the 2nd full hour I've been on the phone with them (should send them an invoice for my time) and she said she finally issued a refund. No offer of a discount, no sending the shoes on top of this massive f*** up.With how big Nike is and the experience they just gave to me they should be offering a refund and shipping the shoes out since their systems and processes are obviously broken and the customer shouldn't be the one paying the price.I will never be shopping at Nike again for how they handled this issue. Should always make your customers happy as you never really know how much reach the customer on the phone has with social media in 2019.",2019-06-25T16:40:26.000Z,Nike

To get my money back for the item that they still haven't even sent me, they're trying to make me jump through hoops, which if I complied would cost me far more money in time away from my small business than the measly $15 I'd get back for returning a kid's shirt that I didn't even order.Crazy.",2019-06-21T23:35:32.000Z,Nike
"Good shoes, poor customer service",Joseph Findlay,2,"Now first of all, I'd like to say that Nike shoes generally are of excellent quality and good value for money. That's not what my low rating is about, it's the customer service that I have issue with. I purchased a pair of running shoes, and when they arrived they appeared different to the photo. I contacted support, and they offered a return and exchange with a 15% discount and a promise that this manufacturing issue was a one off. After going through the hassle of this, the new shoes arrived... With exactly the same problem. I contacted support again, and they told me that this was actually how the shoes were supposed to be from the beginning, and that the images online were outdated. They gave me a 15% discount code for a future purchase, and that was that. I don't find this acceptable. They should have at least given me a partial refund for my troubles and their dishonesty, not something that is designed to make me give them even more money.",2019-06-21T10:29:33.000Z,Nike

Cannot believe the abysmal customer service as well. Nike says I need to pay to ship them to their head office and after 4-6 weeks they will let me know what they have decided.

The Nike Hyper Predators were the most comfortable cleats I had ever worn, and in terms of tightness and material design, they were exceptional. The Adidas Predators, on the other hand, were tight, developed with poor materials, and seriously strained my foot.

I was like give me the discount for this order because there won't be a next time. If you can't then cancel. Then they said they can't cancel the order only within 30 mins of the order. I said just refund me now since you still have 3 of the 4 items I ordered and I will just return the hat and you can refund that later.

However, when I went to Nike.com I could not find a single Golf Bag on your site. So, I called customer service and they told me they were all out of stock. I don't accept (believe) that answer. That would be like looking for a cap/hat and telling me that every cap is sold out. It would be like going to the Ford Dealer and them telling me that all of their models are now sold out. It makes no sense. What is a customer supposed to do? Give up golf until you replenish your stock? Or, go elsewhere & buy a bag & use this voucher on something that I don't need? It seems like a very shabby way of doing business to me. Then, they can't even tell me when any bags will be back in stock - craziness. Is it one hour? One day? One month? One year? or never?

This was from normal use while playing tennis. Obviously, any quality shoe should not develop a hole in them after only two months of normal use, so we filed a warranty claim with Nike. We had to spend $16 dollars shipping from the Bay Area in Northern California to the warranty address at Nike, which was the cheapest cost available (and unreasonably high).I received  a quick rejection to my claim, stating this was normal wear and tear.

I had to follow up again so they can send the courier to come and fetch it. Then they said they received the shoes and it will take 4 days to do a refund and the money should show within 10 days. NO REFUND was done! its been 12 days. It use to be great to wear NIKE, I have not had a problem of a day old in the past.

They’ve turned up today and I’ve been sent the WRONG SIZE. So now what they want me to do is send them back, place another order and pay AGAIN. Which means another week without my trainers because of ‘low stock’..well where are the original ones of the right size that were allocated to me when I placed the order?

Nike SB Nyjah Free WRONG SIZE,Andrius Martynov,2,"Ordered the Nike Sb Nyjah Free size 8.5 shoes from here. Delivery was very fast and commendable but once the shoes came In it said size 9.5 on the outside packaging, I was very baffled so I tore open the packaging and on the actual shoe box it said a size 8.5 so I took it off as a simple printing mistake. Once I actually open up the box and tried on my shoes I instantly felt like I was wearing oversized shoes, and it seemed like I was actually wearing size a 9.5. I brushed this off and told myself that once the shoe broke in it would be fine, but after skating around in these shoes it really wasn't fine. The shoe was definitely oversized, still leaving a thumbs worth of space in the front of my shoes. So yeah not only did these guys give me the wrong sized shoe but they also lied to me which really says alot because I'm pretty sure these guys still manufacture their shoes in third world countries in sweatshops, so I definitely won't be buying any sort of nike related products again and I'll just stick with Vans.

Broken hearted.....,Christy,1,"UPDATE:  Although my son did not have the cleats for opening day of baseball, Nike has shipped the cleats and took $50.00 off.  Nike did have great communication and were very understanding on where we were coming from.Broken hearted.....I ordered my kids custom cleats for a friend of my sons who passed away last year in a car accident during baseball season.  I was excited to do this in memory of their friend. Only to get one pair and not the other.  I called Nike and was told that they where waiting on material and it would be a month for the material to come in.  My question is why wasn’t I notified about the lack of material so I could find another company.  Now my son is upset because he didn’t get his in time for baseball and they will not be ready anytime during this baseball season.",2019-04-27T13:30:04.000Z,Nike

At the start season, she noticed the cleats starting to delaminate on the inside front near her toes. She taped them up and played out her season because she didn't want to break in another pair of cleats. These were $100 plus, cleats mind you. As spring approaches and the team is talking about getting together again, we recently decided to return them to Nike to check out and evaluate. We received them back with a letter, stating that these shoes were ""manufactured"" over 2 years ago and no longer eligible for an inspection. Sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. (These were brand new ..not a markdown,purchased at a very reputable local soccer store).So basically ...thx we got your money ...too bad. So all I have to say is ""SCREW YOU NIKE""...i will never buy another item of yours again.",2019-03-30T22:50:59.000Z,Nike

Absolutely horrendous experience,eva mulek,1,"Absolutely horrendous experience with one of the managers from first floor who by the way would not give me his name because he knew he was out of line! Bought a pair of Nike air trainers in January 2019 from Nike.com so a month ago for my husband. The trainers have been used on weekends only as my husband wear suits to work. We are now end of February so just over a month later the trainer’s sole looks to be peeling away and it looks pretty worn I have went online to read reviews which all suggest these trainers wear incredible badly and super quick so I took it in to Nike town store on oxford street to request a replacement or store credit. I have spent thousands at Nike over the past year or so because I am a personal trainer and wear s lot of gym clothes and never ever returned anything but when you spend over £120 for s pair of trainers especially as a gift you expect them to last for longer than a month. Anyway I was told to go on to the first floor and ask for a manager who was a tall coloured guy in his 30s I showed him the shoes and basically he told me that it’s impossible for the shoes to wear like this unless it was used constantly and for running. I told him they were used on weekends and not for running but regardless they are running trainers so why call it Nike air max running if you don’t want customers to run in them. Than he smiled at his colleagues  and insultingly said to me that people who wear trainers like this should buy timberlands and not Nike’s and that what was I expecting him to do because he is not willing to do anything with tgese and he has tgese trainers and his doesn’t look like this. Of course when I asked to see his trainers he couldn’t show them to me. He was rude, tried to insult me and basically encouraged me to not shop in NIke. When asking for his name he refused to give it to me than I told him I was gobig to contact Nike customer service tgan he has the nerves to smile in my face and say hope you have a nice day whilst he was laughing with his 2 colleagues. This behaviour from a manager is frankly unacceptable and I will thibk twice before I spend any more money at Nike . This so called manager shouldn’t be working in a customer facing role let alone left to be charge of anything. Needless to say that I am hugely disappointed in Nike  and will raise a claim via my Credit card company and sent a complaint letter to head office as the way I was treated is 1 unacceptable second the goods are not of satisfactory quality as per the sale of goods act.",2019-02-24T13:33:22.000Z,Nike

Nike.com Is Great!!!!~BossShay,Marshay Kellum,4,"Nike.com is the most reliable website to shop on for athletes, coaches, and people who like wearing comfortable sports wear. Nike.com is especially beneficial to last minute shoppers and people who don’t like waiting, like myself. I often shop last minute and have looked at other websites that have nice stuff that I’d want to buy, but their shipping was like two weeks wait which made me turn away. Also I have shopped on Macy’s to get some sports wear and their was a max amount of money I had to spend on items in order to get free shipping and I barely wanted to pay for what I had in my shopping cart. In comparison, Nike.com has free shipping for members and their shipping is two days to no more than a weeks’ wait. With all of the other websites I have shopped on like Macy’s, Sporting Goods, Footlocker, and Eastbay: when I finally signed up for Nike.com and shopped, I realized I found that I found my perfect match. I have always been the type of kid who sees something she likes and go buy it whenever I get the money so even when I came up with just $20 I’d go on Nike.com to buy me a T-shirt which I couldn’t do on Macy’s with their max spending rule. When christmas was coming up I knew I could rely on Nike.com to get my shipment in time to give gifts. Nike also sells baby clothing, so options are not limited to age or gender.

SCAM?,OM,1,"The WORST experience shopping online in my ENTIRE life.I would be certain this is a scam if it wasn't for the Nike domain being official. After almost 3 weeks on the phone with them, around 10 different orders that never arrived, more than 15 calls to customer support in which 'we will contact you after finding a solution to all this' but they NEVER do, more than 10h on the phone with them (yes, 10 hours. It's everything on my recent calls, dates, times, etc), and more than £2500 spent, I have no placed orders, no clothes, and of course no money. You are a f*ing big joke and a DISGRACE for the Nike brand.If you ever have to call customer service in the UK, just don't. But if you ever have to talk to Connor or Kelly, then you are really doomed. I've got them recorded lying again and again. LIARS. Nike, get your ** together.",2019-02-17T12:22:46.000Z,Nike

Please don't use DHL to handle all of your deliveries.This is my second time that DHL handled the delivery of my orders and I always have to reschedule the delivery. They don't give updates when it's already on transit or already at your home for delivery. The only update that I got from them is a text message stating that ""they tried to deliver the package but no one was home"".I was home between the time of delivery and didn't hear any ring on my bell or receive any updates.It is frustrating that I have to call DHL to ask for redelivery.  They just stated that the delivery person has more than 200 packages to deliver and they don't get paid to wait for the receiver to pick it up.I woke up early and cancel all of my morning appointment to wait for my package to arrive and I have to do it again the next day because they failed to deliver my package.

I'd give them 0 stars if i could,Mark Burban,1,"I'd give them 0 stars if i could. so i purchased a pair of sneaker on their online store & they shipped after a few days, advising me they'd arrive in about 7 days & supplied me with a tracking number. So i kept an eye on the tracking number & on the morning they were supposed to be delivered i stayed at home, because I was very keen on getting these new kicks. while waiting I check the tracking & see that there has been a 'failed delivery' & that the item is now at my local post office awaiting collection.. So the next day i head down to the post office & they search everywhere & can't find the parcel; nor do any of the tracking numbers nike supplied work. They advise me to contact the store to ask for help.So i email nike, multiple times & receive no reply.. Eventually i manage to connect to them by online chat & i'm told that the courier was unable to find my house & that the shoes have been sent back to Nike.. At no time did nike ever make an effort to contact me to let me know there was a problem with shipping.. nor did they bother replying to the multiple emails i sent them asking about my order? So i got a refund & i hope they don't muck that up as well. Nike just lost a customer of some 20 years.. truely awful customer service.",2019-02-11T03:21:56.000Z,Nike
So today while attempting to buy my son…,Thomas Stamper,2,So today while attempting to buy my son a birthday gift we go to the parkway place Mall in Huntsville Alabama find the shoes he likes and they don't have them in his size. Which is just a 14 not nothing crazy just a 14 that I think all Footlocker should stock on all of their shoes we asked the clerk to go get us 14 in six different kinds of Nikes and every time they could not retrieve the right size. So we go online and attempt to buy the same shoes online but we have the same problem you cannot select size 14 and add them to your cart so this seems like a scam forcing people to spend more money getting the other shoes that are comprable which are the Nike air vapormax Flyknit 2 which he doesn't like as well as the ones that he had picked out.just seems like a nice way for Nike to get $30 more out of somebody for shoes they really don't want when they should have a size 14 in any size shoe on their shelves at the store and online very displeased perhaps Adidas or New balance could accommodate a size 14 in any shoe that they sell.,2019-02-10T00:45:11.000Z,Nike

Man is constantly in motion. Therefore, it is very important to pay attention to what we go. The lucky ones are those who can afford to choose shoes to taste, not paying attention to its cost, the rules of the dress code and fashion.Buying the first sneakers was memorable for me.

I ordered a pair of shoes from Nike. I got the item I ordered, but with someone else's receipt in the box. I had to call customer service to get my correct receipt and shipping label e-mailed to me so that I could return the shoes. The shipping label with the incorrect information they already sent me was pre-paid. The correct one they sent me was not, so I ended up paying $17 to ship the shoes back to Nike. They did not send me a confirmation that they received them or that a return was being processed, so I had to call them again. I asked if I could be reimbursed because I had to pay to return the shoes because of a mistake they had made. They said they would give me a discount on the next pair of shoes I ordered...even though I am obviously not eager to repeat this experience. It's not so much the amount of money, it's the principle. They made a mistake, then made ANOTHER mistake on top of it, and because I didn't have time to make yet another phone call to them asking them to send me the correct label, I had to pay for it and they are not willing to meet me halfway.",2019-01-26T16:41:08.000Z,Nike

My partner calls DPD who said that they will get the depot to call. This was at about 1:30 p.m. at 5 p.m. she call DPD back and a different agent stated that the label on the package did not have the first line of the address on it so they could not deliver it. We asked why they didn't call the phone number that they have to confirm door number  they then stated that they don't do that and that they will not be able to deliver it again at all as the label is wrong. We called EE who arranged for my partner to pick this up from a pick up point the next day. No apology and no offer of compensation even though they were told that this was a birthday present.Deliver 2) my partners ordered shoes from Nike.com and deliver was through DPD. On the day of delivery notifications received saying that it is on its way and partners actively tracked it on her phone until it said that DPD were here, we waited for the bell to ring but nothing. 5 min later we received a notification stating that no one was home and a photo of our front door. We called DPDD customer service and spoke to Corey who allegedly tried to call the drover but could not get tgrouch and then we're told that there is nothing they can do.

If I could give this a -1 then I would,Ben Parker,1,"If I could give this a minus score then I would. I ordered my first pair of shoes recently from the Nike app and it looked great. When it arrived the shoe had a large pen mark on the front of a supposedly new suede brown shoe. It looked awful. So I tried to send it back and get a new pair. Next day I gave it to the collection people and sent it back. It arrived at Nike two days later (I had to find this out myself as I wasn’t even made aware). I waited several days for any sort of response and got nothing. Eventually I had to call them up and ask about it and the person told me that they were not even set for an exchange and will be refunded as soon as they were processed and would take 4-7 days. So after many days of them having them they chose to let them sit there. So I let it slide and waited a while longer. A week later and I was getting impatient. So I decided to ring them again for some sort of acknowledgement as I was left in the dark about everything that was happening. Turns out the person told me this time it will take 5-9 days now. This annoyed me even more as I went to be waiting almost 2 weeks for them to simply give me an email saying they were being at least looked at. If I was updated regularly about the process and how long it could take then I wouldn’t of minded so much. But this was just ridiculous. Then they had the audacity an hour after I called them for the second time about the shoes to START processing the shoes. They then sent me an email for the first time since they gave me the shoes 2 weeks from when I sent them back acknowledging me and the shoes. Then followed with an email two days later saying that they are refunding it. So much hassle and stress over nothing. I’m waiting on the money to be transferred to my account still even to when I’m writing this. Product was faulty, service was terrible and a waste of my time. I also got another email saying for me to give feedback and fill a survey for them... no. And then a further email offering 20% off next purchase. If I was getting something like socks for free as a token of being sorry then maybe but I am not giving you another penny. PLEASE MAY I STRESS!

Horrible exchange experience!,Martha Alvarado,1,I did an exchange online at Nike.com & the lady checked that they had the item I wanted before placing the exchange order. I was told it would take about a week to be delivered & that all I needed was the order # to check the status. I called back a week later & got told 3 different things & hung up on twice because at the moment I couldn't verify the email address that placed the order. I had everything including the debit card that paid for the order & tracking receipt # from UPS. I basically got the runaround & in the end I know why. This exchange was done the beginning of Dec. & at the end of Dec. the day after they assured me that it would be shipped they cancelled my order because they no longer had the item in stock. Now I'm told not even corporate can help me out. All I can do is go to a store that has it in stock in another state or reorder from a store at a higher price then I originally paid. Go figure. I found it in a store not affiliated with Nike 2 hours away from me. No thanks to anyone at Nike.,2018-12-13T02:49:05.000Z,Nike

Extremely bad experience,Aliya,1,"Extremely bad experience. You would expect a company like Nike to have good customer service or at least delivery. I ordered Nike fleece shorts online and was expecting on 4th december as I am travelling out of country on 12th december. I tried to track the package which says that the receiver agreed to pick it up from UPS location which was never the case. Neither did I ever receive a UPS note about order being missed nor was I contacted in any way to be informed about the same. I am travelling in 2 days and with all the other things, they are making me run around UPS stores. When I called them,the system didn't recognize the numbers I typed and was the most inefficient system ever. Also, after finally getting to a representative, I did not get information on which UPS store had my package and where should it be collected from. I was just given three numbers to call and ask for my package without the proper locations. I asked the representative to send me the details via email but being the inefficient service it was, they just gave me the numbers and asked me to go about it.",2018-12-10T02:01:39.000Z,Nike

Needless to say he had a wonderful time while me and my left arm near the elbow was attacked by a huge shoe box flying of the shelf. Well needless to say I informed the store manager. Who took no report after showing him my bruise. Now it's two days later and my arm is still sore and now looks like I have been in a fight.

1 star because 0 is not an option,Jon Orthmann,1,"1 star because 0 is not an option.  Have been trying to purchase vaporfly 4% for about 9 months now.   They are rarely available so I check every day.  In mid November saw they had some in stock.  Immediately made an order but at the last stage it gave me an error code when I tried to pay with my debit card.  Called them and tried to place the order online.  They went through the process and got to the payment point and also had an error message.  They said it was because I was using a non-US card and gave me another number to call.  Called them - went through the same process only to get the same issue.  Several calls and hours later (overseas phone call) they finally just disconnected the line.  Tried again the next day by phone using a US bank debit card.  Same issue and said they couldn't understand the error message - that it had to be reviewed by their 'Elite Sales Team'.  They assured me they would hold onto the shoes in my cart until they could get back and resolve the issue.   More than 3 weeks later still no follow-up.  I call or chat online a couple of times a week to see if anyone can tell me if it is still being followed up and when they will reply.  Just tried again now.  Same answer ""Rest assured that it is being handled by our Elite Team that expertly handles this issue.""  They can't tell me when this might happen.  The shoes of course are no longer in stock so even if they could fix the problem I can't buy them.  There seems to be no way to talk to someone with more authority or able to really take action - when I ask for a supervisor I get put on hold for about 30 minutes then disconnected.  If anyone has a way to actually get to talk to someone who can deal with this please let me know.  I like the products but this level of service is truly horrendous.",2018-12-07T13:52:28.000Z,Nike

The shoes aren’t the issue,Amanda,1,"The shoes aren’t the issue, but I tried ordering a pair of converse via the Nike website and my payment would not process multiple times. Useless customer service reps tried blaming it on the debit card that I know has funds available and which I use regularly. I received an email asking how I felt about my experience with the customer service on the site, and explained my situation. I got a response back weeks later stating that “they do not accept credit cards from New Zealand at this time” I live in the states and my card is linked to a bank here so I think they should work in fixing whatever the issue is instead of blaming the problems on the customer. I ended up ordering the sneakers through another website and will never purchase anything directly from Nike in the future, especially seeing as I googled the error code I was originally receiving and am far from the only one who’s experienced this issue.",2018-11-30T23:43:54.000Z,Nike

Shame on you Nike,Cathy,1,"I bought my daughter Nike KD-10 basketball shoes in September 2018. After not even 10 practices the air pockets in her right shoe deflated. I was told by Nike to send shoes to Toronto to be inspected. As asked, this is what I did at a cost to me. I was told through a letter and email that the inspector did not feel it was an issue with their shoes and their warranty will not cover it. The shoes are brand new, I wish I could send a picture with this review. While doing more research, each sports store you go to talks about these issues with these specific make of shoes, in fact one actually shared that an entire teams shoes were sent back. Shame on you Nike for your extremely poor customer service.  My daughter reps your shoes (training & street style) and Nike clothing on a daily basis, but now has a story to tell about her recent experience with your product and customer service.

#teamNike,C Le,5,"I’ve spent a lot of money through Nike.com and they’ve never let me down so far. I’ve bought mostly footwear but also clothing and some accessories.Dispatch and delivery is quick and the courier company is one of the best as they give you a 1 hour time slot so you can run errands and make it back in time to receive the delivery.Every single thing I’ve received has always been packaged well and nothing has been damaged in transit.On the rare occasion I’ve had an issue it was with their hypercool baselayer tights that had the Nike Swoosh peel off on two separate items through no fault of my own. I spoke to a lovey guy through the online chat and explained my issue. He seemed to actually care, was very professional and personable and arranged for me to send the items back with the returns pack he sent to me and refunded me for the items plus something extra for my troubles. I just wanted a pair of tights that didn’t have the swoosh peel off but this was honestly the next best conclusion. I loved that by sending the tights back Nike’s relevant department could see what the issue was and resolve it for future products.Their app is extremely easy to use and I love their easy returns and great 30 days change of mind policy. It takes the stress and worry from buying online. Although I just wish their clothing was as durable and long lasting as their footwear.",2018-11-24T13:25:55.000Z,Nike

Hadn't had any confirmation from Nike so phoned a week later to chase up and was told that these hadn't even been scanned back in yet.  Nor was there any way of knowing when this would happen, and thus when the refund could be processed. This is completely contrary to the refunds policy shown on their website. The guy I spoke to did his best to help and I can't fault him but sounds like his hands were tied by their slow systems.Moreover, I was on hold for 10 mins on the 'returns & refunds' line; the phone finally rang but then just went dead, so I had to start the process all over again and choose another option.

Abysmal customer service,Jessica,1,"I absolutely love Nike; the majority of my workout gear is from Nike and I only wear Pegasus or Winflo shoes for running and the gym. However, following my latest experience, I won't be using Nike again. I put in an order for a new pair of trainers, since I needed a pair with more cushioning. I waited in all day on the expected delivery date, only for them never to show. I then checked the tracking info - said that they had been cancelled. I was frankly really appalled that a massive vendor fails to let its customers know that their order has been cancelled; I had had no communication from their team, no explanation and I am a really loyal customer. I had to contact customer services which in itself is somewhat of an ordeal. They have no email address to send complaints to, so it is pretty sketchy because it means there is nothing in writing and you don't get a solid response from them. The lady who I ""chatted"" with online did not have the greatest customer service skills; it was like pulling teeth trying to get them to apologise for something which is actually pretty bad if they want to keep customers. She actually seemed pretty aggressive at times too,which only antagonised me further. The fact that there is no official complaints procedure is really bad because you don't know if anything is actually going to be done about the issue or if they're just going to continue the way they are. Basically, this combination of bad customer service both in terms of no communication regarding the status of my order and the lady who ""helped"" with my query has led me to the reluctant decision not to use Nike anymore. I have found GymShark to be very good with regards to clothing (and their dispatch rate is phenomenal), but will have to investigate adidas/new balance and so on to find a new set of trainers. Well done for losing a customer who has probably spent thousands of pounds with you.",2018-11-12T16:58:05.000Z,Nike

Nike employee attempt to tempering my connection so i cant buy their shoes,Salvo,1,"So here is the thing, i love nike but i never buy a jordan and dont wanna pay a resell for jordan not because i cant buy it but i rather buy a designer shoe if the jordan that i want is too overpriced, so the moment i see the jordan 1 NRG ""not for resale"" i really like concept, i fell in love with the shoes, so i wake up early to queuing the countdown of the shoe, i log in to my account and waited, after the countdown has over i chose my size and click add to chart and guess what ? It answered with a pop up message called failed to fetch ! , i waited for a frickin 3 hour ! like what the F ! normally if somebody is already purchased and in the process of payment the pop up will said ""sorry other customer is already purchasing this pair and in the process of payment do not give up you can purchased it if the customer not paying within a minute"" Ok i think maybe it was because this time because of the hype the demand is high, but guess what the second attempt i try to click add to my chart it worked and NRG succesfully landed into my cart i fastly clik checkout, but the moment i click checkout, here comes the endless loop of loading ! And boom, i come back into the jordan 1 NRG not for resale Page ! Like, i dont know man if Nike website developer is so dumb enough that their website cant even differentiate between someone who truly buy to wear the shoes or some people who buy it using a bot to resell it for a hefty doubly mothastupid price ! It killed the concept purpose of the shoe itself ! Or i dont know maybe it because soo many of your employee that backdooring the shoe so that your loyal customer could not even buy some shoe that he really like by tempering your customer connection ?

"NIKE - Never Again! - Poor cust. relations, sub-par cust. service, Arrogant bad example for kids",Jay Harvey,1,"Yes, NIKE is currently taking heat for a poor choice in their advertising campaign, but my complaint is about Nike Customer Service and Customer Relations which are inexcusably sub-par and unacceptable for a premium company.  Today, I called to get help with a $200 shoe only to experience a smokescreen of unenthusiastic, low level cust service. I had to ask for a supervisor. With much resistance, finally a helpful person (somewhat). Because I just spent $400 on two pair of Nike, I was annoyed at the difficulty and stonewalling from Nike. I decided to share my experience, so I called NIKE - Main Office asked for Cust. Relations, wasted 34 min in cue, and finally hung up in disgust with NIKE.  I created my own solution. Both pair will be returned this week. Done. NIke is simply not a company that cares about their customers satisfaction, just their money. Returning my $400+ purchase will make me feel better even though nothing will change at NIKE.  I have choices. Nike will never again be on a Christmas or Birthday list for anyone in my family. A decision of which I am even more proud to take in light of the bad choice Nike made in trying to elevate Colin to the same league as REAL Heros Like Pat Tillman! ! ! Good timing.

Ignorant Decision,Peter Pan,1,"Let’s see, Colin Kaepernick ‘sacrifices’ a LOT! Nike makes shoes that resulted in over 1,700 young black men being killed in 2015 by other young black men for some Air Jordans…. I do not see ANYTHING being done by Nike to prevent this. No advertising…nothing. Now Nike pays Colin lots of money for the Just Do It Campaign, which according to him is the violence against black men. Do you think that Nike should do something????“These shoes are important,” D.C. prosecutor Ella Gladman told Okun during her opening statements as she recounted details of the shooting from her witnesses. “These shoes are the reason James was killed.”Prosecutors said the teen witnesses saw James fight with the person who demanded his shoes then lost sight as James fled. They did not see the shooting, but arrived soon after, prosecutors said.“The witnesses saw the defendant after the shooting running away, holding the red sneakers in his hands,” Gladman said.From Sports Illustrated 1990: THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON A LONG TIME!There are deeper societal issues of violence and status involved. Looking back at Sports Illustrated’s famous 1990 cover story, “Your Sneakers or Your Life,” which focused on the murder of a 15-year-old boy over his Jordans and brought sneaker violence to national attention, it’s evident that the 17-year-old killer in that case didn’t do it just for the shoes. The victims of these crimes are disproportionately young, black men.Undoubtedly, however, sneakers continue to create opportunities for some problems to play out. Early on, the Sneakerheadz clip shows news footage from a mob scene of customers stampeding to get newly released Jordans, and stories of actual deaths are far from rare.What can be done about it? Twenty-five years after Sports Illustrated’s big story, there’s still no good answer.",2018-09-04T12:28:28.000Z,Nike

Air max 97 defective 2 times ordered,ΨψψΨ ΩωωΩ,1,"Hi. I have bought from the Nike website pair of shoes which came with small but noticeable defects. At 150 pounds a pair I would expect perfection from their side. I returned them after i send photos to their email adress with the hope that if I will buy another one will look like I would expect even though I had to wait one week for the money to be back in my account. They offered a discount and that is why I have decided to give them another chance. The second pair, a new type of defects worse like the first one . I have the feeling that no one is doing any kind of quality check. I had the thought that a fake replica of this shoes will look better than the original since some of them pass as genuine all the time. Very disappointed, not because of their service but because of the product. I have various Nike shoes bought from different retailers at much better prices, but I wanted to buy something new directly from them and to expect a nice experience and quality products. Not this time.Thank you Nike for this experience and because the only solution that offered me customer support was to buy it once, even if that meant paying over 400 pounds in just a few days and waiting a week for a refund for each transaction.

Reliable Returns Service,Paul Wheatley,4,I have several types of football boots from Nike.I bought one expensive pair which I had used once and wasn't suitable for my playing experience and I this explained to them. I politely asked for a exchange / refund and they were really prompt in offering a refund and also paying it back to my card.It's when there is a slight problem a company's customer service is properly tested and I was most appreciative.Because of that I look forward to using those funds to buy a different pair of Nike football boots.,2018-06-12T15:30:11.000Z,Nike
Shocking service at Oxford Circus…,Alex B,1,"Shocking service at Oxford Circus store.A quiet time and one member of staff was so rude when I asked where the women's trainers were.Despite their obvious distain at my interrupting their general chatting about 'shiz' I persevered and found the women's trainers.After being offered no help by the chav styled girl quite literally doing nothing and whose sole job it was at that time to help customers with trainers I just ordered a pair for my girlfriend - simple I thought.So I then watched whilst she took the confirmation of an order as a prompt to chat to her mates, catching up before she, as a side thought, found it within her to order my trainers. 5 mins passed and not even a 'they'll be out in a minute', just some chatting with her mates, who also seemed to also revel in not helping people, maybe inwas jaded at this point though.  Still, I didn't interrupt as she was having such an amazing time, so I gave up and walked out.  I quite literally hated the experience and left feeling like my custom was actually a hindrance to them.So that's it, done with Nike... congrats Oxford Street store for making me look at competitors ...that is the only gift I came out of there with! My summary of Nike would be that they are trying to trade as a premium brand, but in this day and age it's the whole experience that gives you that and they are falling way short..my advice, go to a high end retailer for better quality experience, or just buy online and cut out the horrible store.",2018-06-11T18:39:25.000Z,Nike

Really good experience,Pankaj Rajan,4,"Ordered the new football pants off here and got it yesterday. The fit was perfect and their size guide and general tips are accurate. Customer service is really good. At all stages of the ordering and shipping, the customer service was helpful in sharing information that you can't see on the website (Tracking won't show till it is in your country). The only flip side is shipping to NZ is very arbitrary (3-12 days) and mine came in 10 days. Wish they could do it sooner considering that shipping is being paid for by the customer. Also, not much difference between Standard and Express in terms of shipping time but way more expensive. Overall, great experience, great product, accurate but slightly long shipping duration.",2018-05-29T22:29:24.000Z,Nike
"Terrible customer service, still no soccer cleats",Sheila Haynes,1,"I am very disappointed with Nike’s service. I initiated a return/replacement of some brand new soccer cleats on May 7th. We had only purchased them less than 2 weeks prior. I was originally told that I would need to send them back, and then someone would review the problem and either credit me for the shoes, or they would deny the return and send them back to me. Right now they are the only soccer cleats that fit my son so that was unacceptable. I reviewed Nike's return policy while talking to the person, and let them know we were well within the 30 return for any reason policy. One of the shoes was falling apart and I just wanted an exchange for the very same shoe. He realized he was mistaken and that I could return them for any reason. He sent me a return label and I mailed them through UPS the same day and expected a new pair to arrive soon. After about 11 days, I called Nike again because the shoes had not arrived. I learned from the representative that for some reason, Nike cancelled my return. I received no email or any communication about this. Nike received my defective shoes, and then just didn’t send me another pair, or issue a credit to my card.  Meanwhile, my son is playing in borrowed shoes that don’t really fit him. The representative I spoke to apologized and said that a pair would be sent out right away, and would arrive by either today, May 22nd, or tomorrow at the latest. He also offered me a 20% off coupon for my next Nike purchase, which I have not yet received. My son was hopeful that the cleats would arrive today, but now I received an email saying that they just shipped today. I am very disappointed that Nike didn’t do more to remedy the situation in a timely manner.  If I had not called, I would have been out a pair of soccer shoes, as well as $250.00. On 5/25 I again called Nike because although I received notice on 5/22 of shipment on next day air, the tracking info never advanced and even on 5/25 the tracking info said it would update when it moved.  I do not understand why it has been so difficult to get a pair of shoes from Nike. I spoke to a corporate person I was advanced to to try to get to the bottom of it. No one could tell me where my son’s shoes are. This is unacceptable. We paid $250 for defective shoes and then have to through all of this back and forth to have them replaced. My son is all about soccer, and he has  been without proper shoes since 5/07 and there is nowhere on Maui to buy soccer cleats so we are stuck. Again, the representative said a pair would ship  (5/25) out but wont arrive until the 29th. How is that next day air? I was told that a manager would reach out via email and send me a 20% off coupon. My son is sitting here crying because he has a game tonight and has to wear shoes that don’t fit him. Nike should be doing so much more to fix this. 80% off wouldn’t even be worth this hassle.I would never have bought $250 soccer cleats knowing that if they were defective, it would take at least 22 days to get a new pair (assuming they arrive on the 29th). Today is the 29th and I have received zero information from Nike regarding shipment or tracking so I am assuming they are not on their way.",2018-05-29T17:29:03.000Z,Nike

They gone bad within same period and Store manager responded that they cann't guarantee any product even gone bad within 2 months. I am not sure about this kind of branded quality from Nike through sports direct.Thereafter i logged complaint with Nike customer care and they stated that you have send shoes to Netherland for our test on your postage expenses. I am living in Newbury UK. Thereafter only we can tell about the further procedure. There should be some nearby Nike store to have a look and make judgement.

Horrible online shopping experience,Francis Hys,1,"Great brand, produced a lot of great products especially the shoes, BUT the online shopping experience is HORRIBLE. All my purchases online via Credit Card are always cancelled for no reason even though transaction was a success. In the past, only 2 purchases via debit card was a success. Just a couple of days ago I made another 2 purchases via Debit Card, transaction online were success for 2 Air Jordan Shoes that cost around $100+ & $200+, was so happy because I managed to secure the Air Jordan 3 Retro re-Release after on queue online & I upon checking my bank account, I can clearly see my money were deducted from my account.However, to my shock when I checked back my orders status online; they were found to be cancelled for no reason & without any advance notification or email to me. Now I can no longer re-order the shoe because it is no longer available. To make It worst, my money was not refunded & when contacted to their support staff online, all they do is direct me to write email to another party, which then again reply my query & said that it has “AGAIN” been forwarded to another relevant party. Don't bother trying to talk to their chat support online, all they do is deflect the problem & ask you to email their ""Relevant Team"" for help....which never ever reply your email!The whole process was so frustrating and to this date I still haven’t receive any feedback from them. Not just that I don’t get the shoes I wanted and can’t get them anywhere anymore, but I am also $300+ short from my account that who knows when it will be return. So think carefully if you ever want to purchase anything online from NIKE, TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE AT ALL!",2018-05-08T01:15:50.000Z,Nike

Items are sent double boxed & are box fresh having never been tried on, because I know they fit true to my size, this is perfect for me.Nike, you only get 4 stars as the SNEAKRS app raffle system is flawed I’m afraid. I know you have been trying to tackle the bots & multi account resellers, but it just isn’t working. I’m not bitter because I have plenty of L’s because I realise if there was another way I still may lose! However, check eBay as soon as a raffle closes & you’ve notified winners & there’s a multitude of listings, sometimes 10x market value. It’s a free market economy, resellers are healthy to some extent driving hype for you & not everyone can win but maybe introduce a loyalty bonus for the raffle, whereby your loyal, regular buying public at least get a better chance for all the £’s or $’s they’ve spent to actually wear the kicks at original ticket price.",2018-04-18T18:41:19.000Z,Nike

Poor Shipping and Refund Policy,Kate,1,"I made an order with Nike on May 26. Ten days later I track shipping and see the item is still in transit. The shipping history shows my order went all across the country from Memphis to Honolulu and with several delays in between, stuck in different facilities. The customer service person could not tell me when the package would arrive, but encouraged me to buy the product again and get free (free?!) fast shipping whilst the original order is redirected back to Nike, as if this is in any way compensation. In this case a refund is not issued until original package is returned to Nike, and since I refused to spend more money with them I asked for an immediate refund. Again something that was refused. Nike has had my money for ten days and no product has been delivered to me. I received a standard apology but no solution that doesn’t require me to spend more money.  And I must now wait for the package to be returned to Nike before I am issued with a refund. Note: after ten days, my package is in Honolulu and I am in California.

Nike has turned its sneaker releases…,Matthew P,1,"Nike has turned its sneaker releases into nothing shy of a disaster. From offering NYC only releases weekly to their atrocious online draw system, its evident that Nike can care less about getting shoes in the hands of their real customers instead of targeting re sellers. Scroll twitter and you can see people selling Nike accounts to trick the draw system, not only does Nike not even attempt to even filter these out, they seem to embrace it. It's been clear for a year now what is happening and they choose not to address it. But discriminating against smaller cities is the icing on the cake with Nike implying it only wants NYC to clearly own it's products. In reality everyone should have an equal and fair shot. I have been a very loyal customer for years, but now id rather walk barefoot then to support this brand who shows weekly they just do not care and to go as far as only target single cities constantly.",2018-03-30T22:44:55.000Z,Nike

"Nike.com - ""box-fresh"" sneakers 😀👍",F G F SWEET,5,"Shopping online with Nike.com has always been easy and trouble free. My latest purchase was received exactly 48 hours after placing the order.  Safely delivered by DPD within the promised timeslot, by a nicely presented well mannered happy delivery agent. The quality of my Nike purchase, as expected, is truly exceptional and lovely ""box-fresh"" from the warehouse, guaranteed not to have been ""tried on"" by anyone else but me.  Much better than shopping in-person in-store.From placing my order there were lots of email updates & then a tracking reference for DPD to arrange a personal delivery timeslot.

Headache but Lovely,Claire,4,"I have tried ordering three things, three different times. The first time, I had forgotten my street address (since it was on my app I had put it in LONG ago and apparently forgotten) So, I didn’t know that I did that. I found out the next day because of tracking information.I talked to someone and they couldn’t have been nicer! In fact, I’ve talked to customer service at least 4 different times and I couldn’t have been happier.Anyways, they were going to give me next day shipping for free, because of the mess up. I ORDERED AGAIN, but forgot to change the address. Man, I was feeling really stupid after this.Why try to order another time? I’m just going to mess it up. I did though, and received it a day earlier than was told, except my hoodie. I talked to someone AGAIN and they’re re-shipping it to me with next day air shipping for free.Even though I had a terrible headache of a time with it, I am very happy with the product and the way they treat their customers. Definitely shopping again.",2018-03-21T06:30:14.000Z,Nike

When contacting the company I was told that ugly people do not get hoodies. I was offended but not surprised. I am pretty ugly. I would not recommend using Nike as they will probably give you bacon. I am now very happy using Nike's main rivals, Lonsdale.I will forgive Nike if they give me 5000 V-Bucks.Thank you for reading.P.S- Using Nike is a hard time but the product quality is good.

Well comes to find out it was two different sizes and two of the same feet in the box. Well, we found that out after she blinged them out. And the lady did a great job. I’m so upset with Nike called them and they could not take them back because they were altered. So I had to purchase another pair. I feel like it was their fault they sent the wrong size and two right feet.  I shouldn't have had to purchase another pair they should have given me another pair or send me the correct size and the right foot.

The absolute worst customer service …,Kate Marshall,1,The absolute worst customer service experience I have ever dealt with in my entire history of purchasing items online.  My children received gifts from relatives for Christmas totaling over $500 and simply needed different sizes in the sneakers.  Confirmed with a representative Exchange Policy and stressed the importance of EXHANGING vs. refunding due to purchases being made with Visa Gift Cards that were disregarded after funds were used.  After initial request to exchange and items were sent back to facility I called customer service and confirmed yet again the request to EXCHANGE and was reassured that items would be exchanged.  It took over a week to be informed that items were refunded to the gift cards that no longer exist and there was no way to exchange the items with refund already being issued.  I am now left with two children who are heartbroken about their Christmas gifts and a nightmare of a mess to sort through trying to tract down contact information for the Visa gift cards.

I’ve also had my Nike trainers for about five years and they’re still very comfortable and look relatively new despite again being frequently worn.

Bad Client care from Nike and Converse,Matt,1,"I started calling Nike about 6 months ago (June 2017), it was one number after another and of course everyone I spoke with said they were sorry for the inconvenience I was experiencing... On October 31, 2017 (after four months of attempting to report the separation of my ALL STAR - Converse soles from the rubber trim), I reached Leslie who took all my information and sent it to ""the right department"".  Eventually a ""Greg"" called.  After they claimed not to have any of the colour choices I asked for - including the colour of the defective shoes of course) Greg was prepared to replace mine with another style.  I asked for a few days to see them at a store before making my decision and he accepted.Within the week I called back to confirm the pair I wanted but received no reply yet again.  Several weeks later some guy named ""Kev"" called to say ""Long story short, Greg is no longer with us"".  I found this Kev guy quite offensive as he denigrated the previous employees work ethic while telling me he would not honour the previous employees promise to replace the shoes with another style.  He also claimed the exact replacements for my defective shoes had been shipped ""as we speak"" - about three weeks ago.  I have not received a confirmation of them being shipped and no shipping confirmation from the shipping company either.Not happy at all with the way Nike/Converse ""services"" their clients.I wont be buying Nike or Converse products again as a result.",2018-01-04T21:27:50.000Z,Nike

Very bad experience,Abs,1,"I paid for a pair of Nike Air Max online which was meant to be delivered yesterday (Monday 4th Dec) but it didn’t happen, no one informed me that DPD had returned my order back to Nike.com because they received it damaged so therefore they had to return it back to Nike.com. This is really not my problem. In fact I spent hours on the phone and chat to Nike and DPD yesterday and today to resolve this and I can honestly say it’s been the worst customer service I have ever encountered.I made the order online with the confidence I would get my order in time and very smoothly, afterall it’s Nike right. I could have gone through JD Sports or alternative websites/stores. Nike.com over promised and under delivered here. No compensation yet to the effortless hours I spent on this, the stresss caused and the birthday gift planned for these trainers I paid for which is a massive disappointment as the birthday is now gone so it’s ruined.Nike.com checked stock today for their Kings Cross store and advised to go in as they have stock, I went there and unfortunatly they had a completely different colour so it wasn’t the same product. Really frustrating that Nike.com don’t take responsibility when they have messed up massivly here and compeltely ruined my experience.Not pleased at all and I wouldn’t recommend to shop here now.",2017-12-05T21:33:23.000Z,Nike
If anyone is thinking of buying from …,V craven,1,If anyone is thinking of buying from Nike I would NOT. They are shocking at after sale service and when it comes to getting a refund when you have been sent faulty goods is shocking. I still haven't received mine yet and it was a month ago that I sent the trainers back. I had to go through pay pal to get my refund. There customer service attitude towards myself was shocking... They basically said that it wasn't there problem that the goods were faulty and then I was told that my refund had gone back to pay pal account.but it hadnt. Terrible service from such a big worldwide company.... I won't be buying Nike goods again!!! I'll stick with Adidas.,2017-12-04T20:15:57.000Z,Nike

Lady said I would get my refund once the new pair ships. Never got it. Called today the did says “Oh, we have to wait until we receive the wrong pair.” So I just paid for their mistake.

I bought a digital gift card from Nike …,annaliza,1,"I bought a digital gift card from Nike and it’s already 4 days and i haven’y received it yet. They sent me a digital card which i cannot use as there is no card details indicated on it. Every night i have to reach out to their agents through a live chat and they’re just giving me their  standard reaponse. I thought getting a card online would be fast as they will just be sending me the details. But what they sent me was a card with no number, hence, i cannot use. They sent me multiples in an attempt to correct their error and still no good. I was told to wait for 24hrs, then 48hrs and now they’re telling me the wait should be 2-4days. Really? That’s how they accommodate my concern, by just telling me to wait. It’s just a $75 gift card and they can’t resolve it. I tried asking for a refund, and i was told that it is not guaranteed as i bought a digital card. No gift card, no refund. Just what is this?!",2017-11-23T03:47:15.000Z,Nike

Nike Magista cleat,A Rival,1,"I purchased the Nike Magista cleat for my son.  This wasn't the first time we had bought that style or a Nike cleat.  Always in the past they would last for about a year.  This time the cleat lasted less than 2 months when the top of the shoe started to pull away from the sole.  I filed a complaint with Nike and sent it in for a review.  I received an email back stating that the damage was due to ""normal wear and tear""  not a manufacturing flaw, therefore they would not issue a voucher for a new pair, nor replace our existing pair. There was no visible wear or tear anywhere on the shoe, just the sole pulling away from about 1/3 of the top of the shoe.  When I called, it was just the scripted response over and over from the representative on the phone about wear and tear.  I have told my son to look for another brand to wear because I will not purchase another thing from a company that refuses to stand behind its product.",2017-10-30T21:34:21.000Z,Nike

Nike can't ship a 3 line order correctly,Thomas,3,"I ordered 3 pairs of running shoes online and chose to ship them Next Day Air.  I received 2 pairs on time but never got the 3rd pair.  After researching tracking info and email confirmations, I discovered that Nike’s shipping department screwed up.  The tracking #’s emailed to me did not match the shipping cartons received.Nike customer service has confirmed the missing shipment but I have been advised that it will take 1-3 days for investigation (UPS trace) and up to 15 days for resolution.  15 days really??  They already took my money but will take 15 days to come back with a resolution? I am very unsatisfied with Nike’s e-commerce as they can’t ship a 3 line order correctly and the customer service policy backing it up requires half a month.  I thought a company of Nike’s stature would be more professional.-- Update 10/18The missing box got re-routed and delivered 4 days later.  And, Nike sent replacement shoes at their cost.

"""JUST DO IT""...",Tyrell Turner,1,"My family and I have been a strong supporter of Nike and have been loyal customers for a very long time! We have a beach house in Newport, Oregon so we usually stop at the Nike stores several times a year. My brother received a $25.00 dollar MVP promo for spending a certain amount of money on his school clothes. My family planned on going to a Nike store before the promo ended but my grandma's health has become very bad. She is currently in the hospital fighting to gain her strength back and has been sad because she cannot leave the hospital and does not like being alone. We have also been busy trying to clean the house and set up a room for my grandma so she does not have to go to a nursing home.I explained to my brother that I would call and see if they could honor his promo somehow and make an exception due to the current circumstances I contacted several Nike Supervisors and representatives asking if we could use his promo online/ do a order over the phone/ or even get a gift card sent to are address because we live hours away from the closest Nike store and the doctor hinted she may not live that much longer so didn't want to take the chance of leaving and something happening. (Not like we were going to leave my grandmas bedside anyway!) I contacted one Nike source and asked the employee politely to be able to speak to a manager. He returned after a long wait and said, ""The manager said all we could do is 20%."" (A code that anybody could get online to use toward a purchase and was not equivalent to the promo my brother had got for spending all his money on Nike merchandise.) My brother was upset and didn't understand why they couldn't honor his promo for a hoodie that was in their store and also was online. I was appalled and disrespected that a supervisor couldn't take a minute or two out of their time to come speak to me after I was waiting over the phone for a very long time. I am truly disgusted with Nike and the customer service. I am frustrated that a Billion dollar company and one that my family has supported for a long time could be so petty over $25.00 that a kid wanted to use toward a school Jordan hoodie for winter. I guess my family and I will have to look into a manufacture on the rise like Adidas since our loyalty/families health/ and our hard-earned money means nothing.",2017-09-24T17:23:57.000Z,Nike

What a waste of time Nike are. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,sanjay trivedi,1,"What a waste of time Nike are. Having bought a pair of Nike Tanjun Trainers whilst out in New York, on our return to the UK my son wore them 5/6 times. The Nike logo started to detach itself.I reported this to Nike and they said they need to inspect them.As a result you then have to send them to Holland, at your own cost.If they deem that it is a quality isse, then they will refund on an e-voucher plus up to £20 for postage.All is great you think...... Read on.1. the postage is refunded as a e-voucher too, so you have to spend this with Nike, WHY?2. Since I bought the trainers as a deal in New York, Buy one Get one Half price. Nike will only give you back the discounted price if they deem it is a quality issue. If you do a conversion from Dollars to GBP, the e-voucher is worth £20. Nike do not have Tanjun Trainers for boys at this price online or anywhere else, so now you are forced to spend more. Hence why they give you the postage back as an e-voucher.3. When you email the online Customer service, they will just spout a pre-rehursed company script and policy at you.4. I asked to escalate this to senior mgt, only to be told, they dont speak to customers.I will never return to Nike, as this has just been appauling, their advisors have no common sense they read a script and Nike just want to line their own pockets.Nike,,,, you need to change your advertising slogan from ""Just Do it"",,,,, to "" Go Do One""",2017-09-19T08:43:53.000Z,Nike

Staff was actually telling people that the checkout wait was ""likely an hour or more"".  No complaint that the store was this successful.  We were unable to complete our transaction due to time constraints, we waited 15 minutes and did not move.  We took pictures of the items we wanted and called the next day to get them shipped.  They are not available on the NIKE website, so we called the store.  The manager ""Steve"" indicated he had ""NO WAY"" to accept a payment.  So they could not ship the products. A perfect example of why brick and mortar stores are losing to AMAZON.  Amazon can find a way to accept payments and ship products so you have it the next day.  If Steve thinks he has a long term job at NIKE, he better hope Nike can survive against AMAZON, certainly this NIKE store will not with the current mentality, or is this the corporate mentality?",2017-08-28T19:08:47.000Z,Nike

I returned to the Nike shop I purchased from and expected them to process the card refund in store immediately like other places do but no I had to write down my bank details on a piece of paper….seriously?! Then they sent it to some centre to process and it took 11 days to get my money back!

Now that is really useful if you buy the shoes locally, but why shouldn't you be able to buy their equipment when you are away from where you live. Why should I have to travel nearly 250 miles to return a pair of £100 shoes that I never expected would break?I have already tried and given up with their customer service team, when you ask to speak to the MD they are unavailable, you are sent in the direction of an 'assistant coach'. Which are about as helpful as the original customer service...When I purchased the shoes I didn't think I would need to keep the receipt handy, as after all you would expect quality from Nike equipment right?The fact that they won't offer some help to a loyal customer in this scenario amazes me, and they won't even let you speak to anyone other than the 'assistant coach'.As previously mentioned, I was completely shut out by their customer service and given no alternative but to not play golf until I can afford another pair! Thanks Nike!",2017-07-05T09:54:56.000Z,Nike
You have to call to get a credit for returned merchandise,Debbie Howell,1,"Twice I have returned unused Nike products with the Nike return label that came in the box, and twice I was not credited until I called customer service. They are banking on people forgetting they returned something or just expecting it to be credited to their credit card statement without checking. Apparently if you don't ""call first"" to set up the return, ""it gets lost in the shuffle"" or ""lost on the dock"" or whatever else they tell you... Once I gave them a tracking number of what I had sent back they miraculously found it right away. This is wrong!",2017-07-01T20:48:21.000Z,Nike

I ordered some trainers with no trouble …,Jolie Freeman,2,I ordered some trainers with no trouble on the website but when I received them they are faulty. The left toe cap is wonky and that is not something I would expect considering Nike is supposidly a premium and trusted brand.

Defected shoes cut my left ankle after one day of use and the exchange is a hassle,Anysa,1,"I purchased a pair on Nike Hightops online using Perkbox voucher for part of the payment. The shoes I received are defected. I wore them one day and got cuts behind my left ankle and got home bleeding. Hence I called for an exchange as I like the shoe and the size is correct. Instead of simply exchanging I was told I have to return them, get my money back, wait for the voucher to be processed again, and then purchase the shoes again. Having a nike lab across the street from where I live I don't see why the new pair can't be sent to them (as it was an option to collect from them when purchasing the shoes) and have the exchange there. Hopefully someone will look into their exchange due to defected item policy soon. I was not given any hassle free options even though Nike was responsible for selling a faulty shoe.",2017-06-30T11:21:34.000Z,Nike
Worst customer service ever established!!!,Joshua Chandler,1,after my nike huraches becoming faulty nike confirmed my suspicion however due to the constant lies and misleading information i have sent several letters to their HQ for a FULL Refund but still not heard anything the worst customer service i have ever received from a cowboy of a company will never purchase any items from this company and advise anyone reading this to do the same and boycott this company after opening a claim via trading standards i have signed the legal papers to start the legal process and have also contacted the media to shame this company however the costs will be increased if nike fail to refund once it goes in my favour i will set a deadline if that doesnt get them to refund i shall escalate it to the high court and will bump the costs up,2017-06-29T22:50:19.000Z,Nike
Great Service,Ashar Abdullah,4,"There are bound to be hiccups when purchasing online. In my case the screen showed an error although the amount has been deducted. Though for most this error is unacceptable, as a programmer I know it may be difficult to 100% guarantee that all payment options would function flawlessly.I contacted the customer service online. He promised to check it out for me and did it as well. He wrote back to inform me that it was a glitch and things are back to normal now.Before writing my review, I managed to glance through what others have wrote.

The longest ride,Nora Burns,2,"Look, I'm not one to complain....I have been a fan of Nike since I was young, but my experience ordering online with them recently went to crap very quickly. I ordered a hoodie that I have wanted for a year or two, and just haven't had the guts to spend $60 on it. The package came before the UPS tracking could catch up to it, so that was great...until I realized it was in the wrong color (human error, no big deal, free exchanges too). So I called, guy was super nice, corrected everything - but forgot to send me my return label, and said that I needed to pay an extra $60 to get the new one immediately without having to wait for the old one to return (which I will note he said can take ""4 to 6 weeks"". I decided to wait for my old one to be returned because I didn't want to have a hold of $60 on my account. So I had to call again to get a return label, lady sent it to me and out the package went to get a new one. So I called earlier this week asking what was going on since none of my orders were showing up on the website, and asked if they got my package, etc. The women was very understanding ( I wish I remembered her name - seriously should be promoted), and told me that the man should have just sent me the new one immediately and not charge me an extra $60 because of the fact that it was a human error in the warehouse. So expedited the shipping and it was supposed to get here today (Friday June 16th). Well after a week of this thing being ""preparing to be shipped"" I called and responded to a rep who emailed me because I am, at this point, not having it. Because I emailed the rep, he cancelled my order, little did I know he was going to reorder it because the tracking was messed up, but I called regardless and was asking what the heck happened. The women ensured that it was reordered and it would get to me by Monday (overnight shipping was supposed to happen...I wish this was all noticed on Thursday by my ""case manager"")  I have never had such a difficult online ordering experience and I just recommend everyone goes in store because this was absolutely ridiculous. Pray that I get this sweatshirt on Monday, because I desperately want it.",2017-06-16T21:59:56.000Z,Nike
Be careful when you buy from Nike,Courtney Kostuchowski,1,"Be careful when you buy from Nike.

NEVER SHOPPING AT NIKE HORRIBLE PLACE,Bran S,1,Now let me tell you guys the only reason why I'm putting ONE star is bc it's needed to write a comment otherwise I wouldn't of put any . I ordered a pair of Jordan 11's low the white and blue ones they were to big for me so I exchanged them for a 9.5 . But before exchanging them I called nike asking them if I exchange for a different size is it guaranteed for my shoes they said yes . And to remind y'all I called them 4 times asking them about my shoes they all said I will get my shoes and that ups has a delay .. well they ALL LIED TO ME !!!!! It's now a month after my purchase and I still haven't got my shoes or my dam money back !!! This is how you guys treat a nike plus member since 2015 ?? You guys should of never told me from the start that I was able to get my shoes when I return them ! I called before returning and then 4 days after the return and then I called back 3 more times during that month ! Now here it is may 4 th and the lady said they been sold out for a while now but yet the people you hired at nike told me 4 times ! Not once not twice but four times !!! That I am 100% guarantee my shoes . You guys really did me wrong in this situation I got my email confirmation saying my size is ready they even told me that it's boxed up and ready for shipment they are just waiting on ups to ship BUT IT WAS ALL LIES !!!!!  just because of this experience I will never be shopping at nike any more !!! Not a store or even online you guys have lost a nike plus member since 2015 . Great way to satisfy your customers nike good job .

I had ordered shoes that needed to be exchanged for a larger size and although 2+ weeks have passed since Nike received the returned shoes, I have not received notification that the replacement shoes have been shipped. The rude rep tells me as soon as UPS picks the shoes up from the warehouse they will be sent and I will be notified. UPS comes to my house in the middle of nowhere nearly every day but they don't go to the Nike warehouse for over 2 weeks??? I'm not buying that explanation.

It represents Nike itself, but you could have move it to the back of the shoe or underneath the shoe. As for shirt, you could have design it on the inside or on the sleeve cuff. I'm not buying the product to help Nike promote its brand. I really like that ""Just Do It"" t-shirt but that swoosh logo always present. It's like ""Hey, everyone. I'm wearing a Nike t-shirt.

Nike.com,Dietmar van Dyk,1,Nike indication i regards to the finish product is unacceptable as my package has not been delivered as stated by Nike.com themselves. Their customer support can't even assist due to the limited information they have which means they don't even know where my package is. I will never support Nike again and will inform other people regarding my experience.,2017-02-07T05:41:46.000Z,Nike

Too many shoes,Silas H,1,"I use to love Nike, now it is watered down with poor marketing and pure greed. Not loyal to customers way to many releases for Jordan and the Jordan brand sucks past 2000.",2017-02-05T15:09:13.000Z,Nike
Poor,Gert Kretov,2,Bought a pair of trainer online. The parcel arrived quickly. The size was too big so decided to exchange. Called them and was told no exchanges. Only returns then you get your money back then order again. Ok but will you have those shoe in stock by the time it comes back to you and so on I've asked. Yes sure loads of them in stock.So i send them back and call Nike again a week later. They didn't get my parcel so no refund and they size i wanted is no longer available locally only 200 miles away.How can a company this big does not have exchange service? I'm shocked and so decided no to bother with Nike again.,2017-01-24T21:46:27.000Z,Nike
Nike.com website review,Julie Sullivan,1,"A company this large should not have such bad service.  I ordered an item from the Nike.com website and paid extra for 2 day shipping. It's been 4 days and still no package. The website now says  estimated delivery in 2 more days (which is then a holiday, so it won't be delivered then either). I contacted them via live chat and they refunded me the extra I paid for shipping, however are rude and just disconnect from you before you are through talking.  Nike, you need to step up. I won't order from their site anymore.",2017-01-14T19:54:31.000Z,Nike

I purchased a few sweat suits ""men's"" for my brother & boyfriend ""nice sweat suits"" so I thought until you wash them the suits shrink a lot I most add! I thought ok maybe I did something wrong when washing & drying even though I went by the handling directions on the tag, bought I few more sweat suits this time I didn't wash them I brought them to the dry cleaners bcuz lets be honest these suits aren't cheap so of course I don't want them to shrink but they did so now I have all these sweats that my brother and boyfriend can't wear because they shrunk at least a size an a half!!!

NIKE ONLINE ORDERING,Inna,1,"I placed an order last November 23 on nike's website. Leadtime was 4-6 weeks as it was a nike id, but due to the holidays it was assured that orders would be delivered before christmas. Well, i believed that it would. Under 2-3 weeks the status showed that the built has completed and just waiting to be shipped. A customer's service assured that the item would be shipped right away maybe earlier than christmas eve. I waited and waited until dec 22 still nothing happens. i checked with their customers service again and was informed that something came up with their courier so the shipment could only reach me on the 29th of dec. i decided to cancel my order and was told that it would take about 7-10 working days for it to be processed. Guess what, no email update was given regarding my refund. I feel like i've been scammed or robbed. For those of you who's planning to buy nike online, please think about it and consider buying in stores if possible. Their service is quite lousy and would definitely disappoint you. Totally waste of money. They don't even deserve a star 😡",2016-12-31T14:19:33.055Z,Nike

STAY ALERT,Mahmoud,1,"I was buying Nikes for me and my wife. Shoes were added to the cart and everything seemed to go well. Credit Card number and personal details were entered. Everything seemed okay, no price change at all - yet.. On the page were you accept the terms (the last click before completing the order) the prices changed. It said that the prices were before discount, i thought well okay that seems true. But then I noticed that my wife's sneakers price didn't change. I called Nike support and they said that there was an error. The sneakers were not on discount so they changed the prices while I was checking out. They were sorry, and that was it. What a baaaaaad service. The worst thing is they still haven't changed the price. Please dear friend, do not buy online. Not trustworthy and they may rip you off.

Why only 30 minutes?,Michelle M,1,"Do not order from nike.com. they do not have the best deals on their shoes and it seems like no one on their live chat has any idea what they are talking about. First off they only give you 30 minutes to make any changes or cancel your order. By the time you realize you made a mistake the 30 minutes is up and there is nothing you can do personally. So I have ro live chat customer service where I Talked to one person who said they put in a request to cancel my order. I wake up the next mornimg talk to someone else who said the request was never put through. So I ask them to cancel the order which they said they did but there is still a chance the warehouse wont see it and ship them anyway. I livechat again 30 minutes later to see if this time the cancellation was put through. The person behind the screen says yes it was and the same stuff about the warehouse. Then later on in the day just to make triple sure that the request to cancel the order was put through I talked to someone else who said that the shoes would be shipped whether i ask them to cancel them or not! Despite them not even being shipped yet, which the person said nike prides themselves on shipping fast. I have to wait over a week for them to be shipped, return them, and wait  for them to receive them before I can  get any refund. Then thia person continues to try and annoy me and get a reaction out of me. What is the point?! Not only does this not make any sense but it sounds complicated for not only myself but for the nike company as well. How could a well known company like Nike have such a crappy online service. And it doesmt help that they bought converse who actually had a food shipping service?! I should have way more time then 30 minutes to cancel an order. You would think it is up until it gets shipped. And what was the point of even saying they would request to cancel it if they actually couldnt! Why not just tell the truth !",2016-12-28T00:12:12.459Z,Nike
"Employee great, the male I assuming is management very judgmental and wrong for the way he spoke to her",Shirley Montgomery,3,"I  come to Nike frequently mostly for my kids but today I came in for myself and I saw KJ at the fitting room she is normally their when I bring my kids. She was friendly as always and even remembered my name, well as I was trying on clothes I heard a male speaking with KJ I assumed he was manament as to how the conversation was going. Now what bothered me was that he was having a conversation with her like that in a area where customers are and how he was talking to her. As I was listening i got bothered when He told her he felt if she didn't get the position she may go off or punch him (why would he say that) and asked her what would she do if she didn't get it her response was genuine she told him she would go for something else that she was bothered not because of that but because she kept getting put off, mind you I'm still in the fitting room then he goes on to tell her that he doesn't have to open a position and he is getting Irritated. Then he further goes on to  tell her how he fought for her to stay and other managers will see she is mad. She again told him she was not mad she was frustrated because she kept getting different answers. I was I'm disbelief he basically told her her job and a future position was in his hands. I waited until I no longer heard him,so I came on out and fighting back tears in her eyes she still asked me how did that fit and if I needed anything. I was extremely upset for her and I said no I'm ok and she told me to have a Happy Holiday. I came home and this was still on my heart so I thought you should know. I'm not sure if she felt stereotyped but I felt it for her. So can you please tell her thank you from me and my family for always helping us. She goes above and beyond and does a great job.

For the love of God and humanity, train up your employees to be more educated on your refund policy. It's not rocket science people!

Nike.com order fulfillment - what a joke!,Tim Keough,1,"Ordered a limited edition Tom Brady Color rush jersey almost a month ago (9/23). One day before my estimated delivery date of 9/30 (i.e.: 9/29) they sent me an email saying it was delayed but the new ship date would be 10/7 or earlier. Yesterday (10/19) they sent me an email saying that unfortunately my item is ""unavailable"". As you would expect with a limited edition, this shirt is now not available anywhere so their incompetance cost me the opportunity to get this. Period. Beyond disappointed. When I called to see what they could do to compensate, it took more than half an hour of my time only to find out they had no comparable product, but if for whatever reason i still wanted to do business with them they would offer me a 10% discount. Absolutely a terrible way to conduct business and I'm sure this happened to others too. I won't be ordering from them again and would recommend to others not to trust the brand to deliver on it's promises. Oh, and they still haven't credited back the credit card I used which you think would be a priority given their complete ineptitude.",2016-10-20T19:26:51.640Z,Nike

Lied to Multiple Times About Order,Tim Purcell,1,"Ordered a NFL Football Jersey on September 20th through their website and was provided with a Delivery Date of September 27th (today). On the 25th, I check the order status and it still says Preparing to Ship.   Since that is only 2 days before the delivery date, I think it is a bit odd and contact them via the chat function on the website.  The Customer Service Representative, ""Mike"", basically reads back the status I am already seeing online and tells me to rest assured that the item will arrive as promised.  I found that rather unlikely and asked if it was being sent same day since it was Sunday night and the order was due Tuesday.  I also asked where my order was actually physically located at the time.  I was told, it is in the warehouse and don't worry, I'll get it. I asked where the warehouse was and ""Mike"" told me that it was a secure location and he couldn't share that information.  Really???!!!  I don't know about you but when I order anything online I always get the sending location as well as every stop on the way to my home when I check order tracking.  Clearly a lie and clearly I am being not being provided with any information of value about my order.  Fast forward to the day it is due, the 27th, today.  It is 9:00 PM and nothing has arrived.  I check the website.  The status is still preparing to ship, of course.  I figure I'll try my luck with the telephone customer service this time.  I spoke with a very nice young lady who was still unable to give me any information about the status of my order or when I could expect it to ship.  She did do a search of their retail stores and found two locations that should have the item in stock and she said they should be able to ship it to me.  I call the first location and they were out of my size.  I called the second location, the Nike Store in Las Vegas and a man answers the phone and says they don't take phone orders.  Since I just heard ""Follow up on your Phone Order"" as one of the menu options, I question him on it and he tells me it is a new national policy for all stores that went into affect last week.  Since he says he can't help me, I hang up.  I call back nike.com's Telephone Customer Service and once again speak to a nice young woman, I think her name was Janelle.  I ask her if there is a national policy that stores don't take phone orders and, if they don't, why isn't the Customer Service Center aware?  She speaks to the manager on duty and, apparently, there is no such policy.  This person in the Las Vegas store apparently just didn't feel like doing his job and lied to me as well.  She was very apologetic but  there was nothing they could do to help me.  I ended up just cancelling the order....which was a birthday present...a special, specifically asked for one.  So, this is the first and almost certainly the last time I will deal with the nike.com site.  Their products are good but apparently their retail business both online and physically, is very poor.",2016-09-28T02:32:28.000Z,Nike

Unsave Wildhorse trail models,Tsany Nickolov,2,"Dear Sirs,I am a fan of Nike running products and for a long years I have used and will continue to use very cushioning and anatomic Nike running shoes. But soon I have bad experience with your WildHorse trail model and I want you to improve your products to avoid this in the future for me  :) and for other runners, buying your products for outdoor running activities.Now I can say:Nike promote trail running models (I have problems with Wildhorse trail) which are dangerous when running downhill and outside of the road or tracks.Backside of the outsole is not properly designed and the result is - you are  in danger when running downhill on steep muddy surfaces. It is not only words - I have injured when running in the forest due to this poor outsole design.I could give an idea to Nike Designers about the perfect trail outsole design. Sirs, please see the outsole of VJ Sport Bold 7 Orienteering shoes. It is for my opinion the best outsole grid which is very safe for any outdoor, and for any not flat directions, and for any conditions surfaces.Thank you!With My Best Wishes,Tsany.",2016-08-04T09:38:11.000Z,Nike

Nike hide behinds company policies. High prices! Low customer satisfaction..even after 30yrs.,Felicia,1,"I finally called Nike for help and this is what i get.....S.O.L.As per Nike customer service.mfg date located inside of shoes older than two years will not be covered by Nike. Even if you recently purchased it from one of their retailers, it will not matter.I purchased nike mercurials for men paid over 200$ for it. It was used for two months and one of the cleat broke while playing on grass. I had to buy another pair urgently and totally forgot to call nike to take care of the broken cleat issue. I actually replaced it with the sock style green hypervenom phantoms for over $340 but this time kept the receipt to help fight my case.My point is. The nike soccer shoes are not cheap and i am not happy with nike not even willing to acknowledge the defect because it is outside of their company policies. It is ridiculous and shameful for a big brand like Nike to have their supervisors advise nike customers ""well if you want to return it you can but nothing will come from it"" Basically he is saying the inspection will not start even if i returned it to nike because of the mfg date."" Nike customer service rep and supervisor said sorry we cant inspect it for defects due to the mfg date and it doesnt matter when it was  purchased.Nike said its okay because we can offer 20% off your next Nike online purchase. What is 20% off going to do for me when its clearly a defect and i spent much more on purchasing  soccer shoes.  In fact i just bought a another pair of new soccer shoes phantoms this weekend..i spent over $300 and kept the receipt. I thought nike will assist with my issue hence the reason why i continued to purchase nike soccer cleats. I checked the tag today and mfg dec 2015. I already lost 5 months before outting it on the grass. Can you not cover the warranty from point of sale from either to the retailer or the consumer?To avoid the new cleats from breaking, should it be used on sponge instead of grass? Or would playing on sponge void the warranty?.i tried to escslate my call from the supervisor to his manager and the Nike Supervisor told me the managet would say the samething. The nike Supervisor said its black and white, you can either take the 20% or dont take it. Go figure.

As a customer who literally spends thousands on Nike apparel, I could not be more disappointed by their indifference.",2016-05-10T00:23:31.000Z,Nike
Metcons,Lauren untch,1,I've had my metcon 1s for less than a year. After only about 3 months of having them the fabric separated from the mesh. As a busy mom I just said whatever. Then 5 months I decided to contact Nike because the other side started doing the same and Nike never once responded back to my emails. Great costumer service...NOT!! Now the rubber sole on the back has separated. I switch off shoes daily and only workout indoors so they are defiantly not over worn. Bottom line is in disappointed with the quality of these shoes and the poor customer service. Looks like I'll be sticking to my Nanos and a different company!,2016-05-04T14:57:33.000Z,Nike

Horrible Customer Service,Nikki W. ,2,"Unfortunately, Nike has disappointed me. I purchased a pair of tennis shoes at the beginning of April, and needless to say, I have NOT received them as of yet. Initially I had to return the shoes for a larger size, which they received back by April 7th, courtesy of an email sent to my phone from Nike, that when I called to see what the hold up was, was told by customer service that I was NEVER sent that email..... Huh? And you know that how? Anyway, my order should be here tomorrow, although, it was scheduled for delivery by today! Boy, I tell you, Nike needs to do BETTER!!!!!!!",2016-04-25T15:25:30.000Z,Nike

A bunch of lies,Brian King,1,"My son ordered two pairs of shoes on Friday 1st April. I spoke to Helen at Nike.com to cancel one pair. On Monday 4th, I was emailed to say the shoes were due 12.49-13.49. When these didn't show, I phoned to be told that both pairs were sent and recalled! Mistakes happen.  I called Alexandria at Nike.com, who said she would refer it to the managers; who knows why??? I was told the decision took 24-48 hrs. By Saturday 9th no decision had been made. Anthony at Nike.com said there were no supervisors to speak to to escalate the issue of our order. Then, later said his supervisor would not speak to me.  I have shared this experience with others on my son's football team, and I am not alone in being disappointed. I recommend you avoid disappointment. Avoid Nike.com",2016-04-09T12:24:58.587Z,Nike
Horrible,LP,1,"I ordered an on sale shoe March 23, 2016 and after placing my order on Nike.com arrival said 5-9 days. It is now April 1, 2016 and still no shoe. I have contacted Nike via online chat multiple times and that was useless. I contacted them because my order, still to this day, says ""preparing to ship"". They told me they could do nothing and someone else (I don't even know who) would contact me in 1-3 days telling me my shoe statues. Still no email or shoe. I will never order online from them ever again because of how rude the chat person was and also because of the bad service. I hope other people find this review helpful because this is the worst online service I have ever gotten. Nike is a successful worldwide company and for the bad service I have received it is very disappointing.",2016-04-01T05:23:55.000Z,Nike

He started wearing them in August and to school thereafter.  In October, tabs on the sole fell off.  I contacted Nike, filed a claim, and sent them in for evaluation.

Good customer service at first.....,Cameron,2,I'm currently serving overseas and good running shoes are a must for physical training. My old running shoes are worn out so I decided to order a new pair and due to the fact that there isn't a mall available I have to turn to Amazon to place orders. Amazon wouldn't send these particular shoes overseas and instead of just having them sent to my wife and then having her mail them to me and I'd get them in a week or two I decided to give Nike a chance and just call the online sales number. Near the end of my purchased I'm told that it may take 30-45 days to get here but was assured that it usually takes up to 2 weeks. On Nike's tracking website Nikenarvar.com they give out some USPS tracking number that isn't even a correct tracking number. I spent an hour on hold to talk to USPS just to find out there's nothing that they can do because Nike gave an invalid tracking number. In the matter of 2 days my estimated delivery time has been pushed back by 3 days and each day that I called to find out how they are getting this information if they don't even have a valid tracking number from USPS they tell me that it's just an estimated date. So your telling me that you give out fake tracking numbers along with made up delivery dates? I'd expect more from you Nike but I learned to never order your products from your website. From now on I'll stick to buying from Amazon where I'm able to track items that I spend my hard earned cash on. Forgot to mention how I've been stressing to Nike that I won't be in this country anymore near the 45 day mark and I'll be heading back to the states and their response was well if your not there then they would be sent back to us and you'd have to wait on a refund. So I'd have to wait up to 30-45 days to receive the shoes and if I'm not there anymore another 30-45 days to receive a refund and that is if Nike doesn't screw me over on a refund.,2016-01-01T13:46:21.000Z,Nike

Nike.com,Steve Dille,1,"I find when I deal with national brands that I will have a good experience on customer service if something goes wrong.  I was so wrong with Nike.  I'm not sure what causes their policies, maybe a lot of scammers trying to rip off shoes ordering online and saying they didn't get them...  But they are nasty.  Here is my story - Im in my 50s, a sophisticated online executive with graduate degree and plenty of income.  My son asked for a particular pair of Nike Jordan shoes I couldn't get at Amazon so I went to Nike.com (where I have shopped maybe 4-5 times before.)  I ordered the shoes, entered my address, paid and waited for delivery.    My son began to ask where are the shoes.  I looked it up and discovered they mailed them to an address I had 5 years ago.  Within 30 days from the order, I called their ""disservice center"" and began discussions with someone named Brian about the shoe shipment which wasted about an hour of my time over two phone calls.  I learned that ""they have a two step solid process for the customer to verify the shipment address and I am at fault for ordering the shoes and shipping them to the wrong address.""  If they could get the shoes back, then they could send me new ones.  But there is nothing they can do.  so sorry...  However, they also noticed and admitted that an invalid UPS shipment code was issued so they cant even track the order to be able to verify that the shoes where returned (geez do you think they might have screwed up the address to?).  After two calls of this nonsense and them placing me in the middle of their screwed up processes , I was done.  I told them to just return the shoes and credit my Visa.  At this point they should have just given me my money back and I would have walked away and probably gone to a nike store and bought some.  But Nike refused because they cant get them back because their system issued an invalid tracking number...  And Im supposed to sit int he middle of this and wait for another phone call and waste more time while someone tries to find the shoes...  No thanks.  I told them return them or I am getting of the phone and filing a complaint with Visa and I will not pay for something I never received....  And no I didnt not enter the new address,  I remember putting it in.  Unbelievable service for a national brand.  Most of which have great service.  I can only suspect that everyone no matter how poor or trashy needs shoes and they want Nike shoes so they probably must get a bunch of scammers trying to rip them off so they have created this nasty attitude hardline policy.  Trouble is, they need to figure out when they are dealing with someone legit vs. a scammer...  Beware...  Very messed up company and awful service.  I am now officially never buying another Nike product and I mostly wore Nike tennis gear for years....  Steve",2015-11-06T15:24:37.024Z,Nike
Worst customer service,Tiffany yates,1,"Tried to order launch shoes today. Waited ""in-line""  for 10 minutes, they went in to my cart and by the time I put my shipping and billing info in they were sold. Btw it only took me 2 minutes to put all info in. Called customer service after trying again and was told they were sold out. Asked to speak to supervisor and was told there wasn't any there at the time but they would have them return my call. Called back later and the employee was rude but told me supervisors were there and to hold for a second they would get them for me. Said employee gets back on the phone and says they're busy and that there was nothing they could do anyway. After I proceeded to tell the employee that was bad customer service and I thought it was ridiculous was then asked to hold again and she would see about getting he supervisor again. Waited on hold for 30 minutes before I just hung up! The worst customer service I have EVER experienced. I would not recommend anyone shopping with them!",2015-10-30T18:40:54.990Z,Nike
Horrible,Christina Andrews,1,"I tried yesterday to make a very simple purchase of two pairs of shoes for my son. No sooner had I hit ""submit"" than I realized there was a typo on my shipping/billing address. I immediately (and I mean within 30 seconds) I called the 800 # and was told that it was too late to fix the address, too late to cancel the order and that they would not issue a refund. The order was going to get delivered to a non-existent address and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. I was furious... $237 for NOTHING.After my blood pressure went down, I called back (still within 20 minutes of the purchase online). I asked to speak to a manager... not possible. Trying chatting with Kathryn online. She was unpleasant, unhelpful, couldn't do anything about it.Long and short of it... be very, very careful when you order from Nike. They will not be able to correct any errors, no matter how quickly you call, they will not issue a refund and they will lie to you. They told me they had not charged my card, yet the full amount had been taken from my account. They said they could issue a refund, could not fix the address, could not provide me with the tracking information on the shipment, NOTHING.

I eventually agreed to this, but waited forever. Turned out they were out of stock at Nike.com, so nobody could even complete my order. Three weeks later, a rep tried to help me get in touch with an outlet store for the shoes since they had them in stock, but the coupon code I used was no longer valid.

nike.com is a time-waster,idontcare,1,"I purchased a gift card for nike.com.After shopping their site, I attempted to redeem this card and was met with error upon error at their site.I even tried clearing the cache on my browser, and using another browser. I did receive an email for their customer no-service in a few days but it was of little help, suggesting I call, or try the above remedies I had already attempted. About a week later, I again picked out an item and attempted to redeem my gift card. Well, this time the site accepted it after only two attempts.I then was required to enter my credit card information to pay for shipping. When I did that, my browser attempted to establish a secured connection, and then I received a message that the operation had timed out. I then began an hour long session at their live chat version of customer no-service. There still has been no resolution at this point.They are going to call me tomorrow. I have now wasted hours attempting to buy a t-shirt. Buyer beware!Only purchase a gift card from NIKE if you live next door to a brick-and-mortar store because their website is worthless.If they were to reimburse me at my normal rate of pay for the time I have wasted attempting to resolve this issue they would owe me $100+.",2014-02-15T06:20:02.000Z,Nike

WORST ONLINE SHOPPING,Harriet Amy,1,"Absolutely disgraceful.1. I received an item that had previously been worn and scuffed2. prepaid labels hadn't been sent the 3rd time of asking for them after three promises3. After asking and asking for prepaid labels from the company I then sent the item back with my own courier because I needed the full refund as an customer services Adviser told me to buy another pair instead of waiting for a replacement as this would take to long, I did this so I was £110 out of pocket at that point.4. I then called on the 13th December where a customer services adviser confirmed that my refund had been processed, also that my refund had been actioned and would take 7 working days to show in my bank.5. I have no rang them back only to find that my refund hadn't been actioned and despite me having the item sent and tracked and signed for by the address they gave they're stating they haven't received the returned goods. 6. I have been on the phone for 4HOURS to be told that they can't give me head offices number or pass me onto a manager. -STILL NOT RESOLVED.I don't even want to give ONE STAR for this joke.",2013-12-17T15:00:40.000Z,Nike
Worst customer service I have ever had,Adam Broadhead,1,"I ordered some trainers and was sent what look like used trainers with scuffs so returned them at my own cost as they would not provide me with a prepaid label.City Link: IHZ31612On the 13th of December I rang to make sure they had been received as my tracking says they have and they told me yes my refund will be processed now on the 17th they are telling me they have not received them back.This is the last time I will ever order anything from Nike total scoundrels stealing from people at this time of year is low enough  but to blatantly lie is a joke. This will not be my last words on this I will be contacting my card company and also I will be visiting NIKEs twitter and any other social networking sites to express my feelings and also warn others.",2013-12-17T14:34:12.000Z,Nike

Okay,HungC,2,"A time ago I ordered a football. Everything went well and I had no complaints at all; quick delivery, the right product, decent quality. Actually everything what I expected from Nike! But then, after a few months the football got broken. So I went to the customer service online and asked if they could repair my football, since I still had warranty. After waiting for days (/ weeks), I got no response. So I tried to contact them again, but this time with a different argument for repairing my football. Just in the hope they would respond to my mail! Surprisingly they responsed to my second mail, and they asked me why I mailed them few weeks ago with a different argument! So, they received my first mail, but didn't even respond to that one. But when they received another mail, with another argument, they come up with an argument to let me look like a liar! Still my football is not repaired and it seems they don't even bother about their customers once ordered a product.PS: the mail they sent me didn't even contain any relevant information (about repairing the football).",2013-08-10T14:18:40.000Z,Nike
Great Service,Jonathan Thomson,5,"Not much to be said here, ordered some new trainers online and they arrived very within a couple of days.The best companies are the ones who just get your stuff to your door with no fuss - Nike are one such company.Many thanks.",2013-08-02T17:44:41.000Z,Nike
Probably the finest trainers in the world,Paula Simone,5,"I have been buying trainers from Nike for many years, and thought I would buy them from there official store, as they had some new trainers I cant buy in store.Wow, they were fantastic, with a delivery time of just 4 days, which was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend that you take a look at there online store, as you can buy the latest trainers, before they appear in the usual sports outlets.",2013-06-24T15:13:01.000Z,Nike
Fast and Good Delivery,Filipe Fonseca,5,"HelloI order a pair of shoes from their website, the delivery was expected to 07/06/2013 but arrived one day earlier at 10h00 AM. You can track your order from the USP site (the company that made the delivery).",2013-06-06T14:21:40.000Z,Nike
Great Sportswear from Nike,Brenda Silverstone,5,"My Nike Trainer Shopping ExperienceNike are by far my favourite brand of Sportswear, most especially the trainers. The extra bonus is just how fast they are at Shipping the products, I have never had to wait more than 4 days for them to arrive.I have been buying Nike Branded trainers for over 30 years, and have never experienced any problems with the trainers. Unlike other brands, Nike branded ones really are of the highest quality.The Nike Clothes are equally as good, as all of my children buy them on a regular basis, they are almost Timeless, especially due to the dominent Brand Signature.If you are looking for great Sportswear, look no further, Nike really are a different Class.",2013-04-15T18:54:20.000Z,Nike

Possibly one of the great companies in the world if it would get its website sorted out,Sawyers,4,Headaches when return products online although they compensate you when they mess up. Product quality is unrivalled and the marketing is crazy. I LOVE NIKE.,2012-07-19T03:11:16.000Z,Nike
"Great products, shame about the service!",James McIntyre,3,"Unfortunately this review agrees with Thomas. I have had exactly the same problems as he has. Made an order with standard delivery between 2-4 business days on Monday. However it took them a good five days to ready my product for dispatch! This was on my week off from work and was hoping for fast (in the 2-4 estimated time) delivery. However I was disappointed not to here from them until Friday. Which meant I would be back at work and unable to receive delivery. The products I received I was very pleased with! Seems like Nike have become lazy, taking a very long time to process my order for dispatch. Even more annoying when ou have to pay for P&P! Other websites offer free delivery which often comes next day when ordered early, makes Nike performance look very weak! Shame.",2012-06-12T19:34:47.000Z,Nike
A mixed experience,Mysshopper,3,"Earlier I have placed serveral orders from the nikestore.dk website, and In overall been quite satisfied on the service recieved. But lately I have had a couple of annoying experiences in placing orders from this website. If I ""fall in love"" with any of the goods on the website and want to buy these, I often choose from the possibility to recieve the goods Expedited with UPS, which has a stated timeframe to Denmark on 1-3 days. The only problem is, very often is has not even been shipped from the store within this timeframe. The last 2 times I have placed orders from this website I first recieved the orders 5-6 days after my order was placed. And it is quite annoying to pay 70 DKK for an express service you do not receive anyway. Last time I naturally claimed this fact at customer service and the representative made a cash back for me :0. Latest I placed an order last tuesday and this order has not arrived yet. I really look forward to see, when it arrives. My only recommendation for Nike is to cancel the ""expedited service"", when you are not able to deliver this service - You create falsch expectations !.",2012-05-21T08:29:10.000Z,Nike
They even let you return NikeIDs,Tim Mace,5,"Couldn't believe it when somebody designed me some trainers, they ordered the wrong size and they accepted the return. Just hope they are recycled properly :)",2011-12-30T23:24:28.000Z,Nike
Exceptional service as standard,Miss P,5,"I ordered some items which unfortunately did not fit and Nike gave me a full refund (including delivery) and supplied a postage-paid returns label in addition to offering me free delivery on my next order. I ordered other items which i again wanted in a different size and again they issued a refund etc and another free delivery code for my next order. They sent emails confirming the order; date order was shipped; date return received; date refund issued and date refund completed. Nike offer exceptional customer service and always high quality products, with the assurance of a hassle-free returns policy.",2011-08-11T03:46:31.000Z,Nike
