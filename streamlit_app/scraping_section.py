    - **Target specific categories and/or companies** (depending on the scraping script and parameters used).
    - **Extract key information** from each review, including:
        - Review text
        - Rating/Stars given
        - Date of review
        - Company/Category information (where available)
    - **Handle pagination** to collect reviews across multiple pages.
    - **Implement rate limiting and error handling** to respect Trustpilot's terms of service and ensure robust scraping.
